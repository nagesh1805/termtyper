I got something for you. Open up. Oh, I love the way she does that. W, X, Y and Z Good morning, class. Good morning, Miss Viola. Right. Well, today we begin with the most important lesson you will ever learn. at Penguin Elementary. Does anyone know what that is? Anyone? Anyone? Someone? Seymour? Fishing? No. Mumble? Don't eat yellow snow? No, that's not it, no. It's our Heartsong, Miss. Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, yes. Without our Heartsong, we can't be truly penguin, can we? No. But, my dears, it's not something that I can actually teach you. Does anybody know why? Anyone? Anyone? You can't teach it to us, ma'am. because we have to find our Heartsongs all by ourselves. Well done, you. It's the voice you hear inside. who you truly are. Yes. Thank you, Gloria. Excellent, lovely, thank you. So let's all be very still now. Take a moment and let it come to you. I got one! Pick me! Pick me! Pick me! One at a time. Yes, Seymour. Don't push me 'Cause I am close to the edge I'm trying not to lose my head Yes, I like that one. I could really get jiggy with that. Lovely. I'm ready. I got one. Oh, I thought you might, Gloria. Midnight creeps so slowly Into hearts of those Who need more than they get Daylight deals a bad hand To a penguin Who has laid too many bets That's as far as I got so far. Oh, yes, lovely. Really lovely. That's beautiful. Well, Mumble, since you seem so keen to share. And another boom. You heard that in there? Do you like it? I'm afraid that's not a tune. It's not? Oh, okay. Who is that? That is the offspring of Memphis and Norma Jean. The wee hippityhopper. It's not funny! No. No, not in the least. A penguin without a Heartsong is hardly a penguin at all. I think he broke my ear. In all my years, I've never, I mean And you having such fine voices. Well, it's bizarre. Did anything happen, you know, during early development? No, all fine. Normal incubation. Right. Wasn't it, honey? Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough winter, I guess. Right, right. He did hatch a little late Yes, I understand. Yes. To think he might spend his life alone. Quite, quite. never to meet his one true love. Oh, please, Miss Viola, isn't there something we can do? Well, there is always Mrs. Astrakhan. Mrs. Astrakhan? If anyone can, Mrs. Astrakhan can. Can't sing? Can't sing? Rubbish, darling. Every little penguin has a song. When I have finished. your singing will be giving everyone the goose pimple. Now, to begin. First, we must find a feeling. Happy feeling, sad feeling. Maybe lonely feeling. You feel it? Good. Now, let it out. Be spontaneous. That, what is that? I'm being spontanyouus. Darling, you want to meet beautiful girl? You want to make the egg? Oh, yes. Well, sing! And no jiggyjog. Do not move muscle. No moving! Twinkle, twinkle, little star Enough! Okay. We go back to the top. Forget body. Look inside soul. Feel the feeling. Enormous feeling. So enormous it fills whole body. It must escape or you explode. Now, open your little beak. Come on. Yes, yes. Lift up the head, that's it. Now. Now. Now Disaster! Catastrophe! I never fail before. Never! Never! Well, I thought it was kind of cute. But it just ain't penguin, okay? So what if he's a little different? I always kind of liked different. He's not different. He's a regular emperor penguin. Hey, you know what? I can leave school. I can go to work. The three of us. Whoa, little fella. You ain't going nowhere till you got yourself an education. You get them singing muscles big and strong, you got that? I'll try, Pa. You bet you will. The word triumph starts with try, and it ends with.? Umph. That's right. A great big umph. I'm going fishing. Oh, Mumble. That first hard summer. while his mom and dad were working overtime. on the great commute to the sea. Mumble found a place away from disapproving eyes. where a funky little fella could be himself. Hey, what you doing there, flipper bird? Nothing. What are you doing? Nothing. Just dropped in for a little lunch. There's food? Here? Leg or wing? Oh, no, no, wait. Not me, I'm a penguin. Exactly. The flipper birds, that's you, eat the fish. The flying birds, that's me, eat the flipper bird and the fish. And lately, there ain't a lot of fish. So. This time I'm getting the juicy bits. Me first! Hey, you want a piece of me? Hey, hey, hey! I'm trying to think about lunch. Wait! Watch this! Yeah, that's weird, all right. Listen. For once, we're gonna do this civilized. Now, get in line Hey! What's that on your leg? What? This little thing? Oh, no. Don't start him on that. Shut up! The little flipper bird asked me a perceptive question. A question like that deserves an answer. Here we go. Alien abduction. Oh, you had to ask. Have mercy. Quiet! Now, little buddy, there is something out there. Creatures. Not like us. Bigger, fiercer, and smarter too. Ask me how I know. How? Because I've been captured by them, that's how. Unbelievable. What do you mean unbelievable? It's true. I'm sitting on a rock, minding my own business. when suddenly, they're onto me. These beings, like big ugly penguins. Fat, flabby faces with frontways eyes. no feathers, no beaks, and these These appendages. They probe me. They tie me up. They strap me down. They take this pointy thing and they stick it into me. And then, blackout. Gosh. I woke up and there's this This thing on me. Every flying bird is dissing me, Hey, what's happening, yellow leg? It was humiliating. And then what? It was humiliating. What more do you want? They could have eated you. Yeah. Yeah. I guess my pitiful cries for mercy appealed to their better nature. Can I appeal to your better nature? Nice try, kid, but no. No. No. No! What you doing down there, flipper bird? Get up here. Get back up here this minute. Oh, great. You let him get away. Didn't you? All your screwy alien talk. Hey, I'm an abductee. Abduct this. Don't make me call Uncle Angie. Oh, fine. Where youse going? I'm an abductee! I don't care what you are, I'm hungry! Would you like to hear our specials? How about fish? There's no fish. How about penguin? There's no penguin. What are we gonna eat?! There's a world where I can go And tell my secrets to In my room Paying no mind to his dancing heart. the kid saw out his school days at the back of the class. lost in his imaginings. Now it's dark and I'm What fabulous worlds lay out there, far beyond the ice? I won't be afraid Was there any place. where one small penguin without a Heartsong. could ever truly belong? In my room And so, a thousand generations ago. our forefathers forsook our wings for flippers. You graduates going to sea for the first time. are to reap the benefits of their wise choice. These are lean and uncertain times. But by the power of the ancient penguin wisdoms. we, my brethren, will endure. Blah, blah, blah. Norma Jean. Who is he to say my boy can't graduate? He's not hurting anyone. true to our ways and you will always be worthy of this. our brave penguin nation. Excelsior! Ocean, here I come! You know what?

All the love in the world can't be gone Mumble! All the need to be loved can't be wrong Mumble! Disgraceful! Who do they think they are? Where is Noah? This is getting out of hand. Go! Hey, Memphis. It's your boy, Mumble. Mumble? Mumble? No, no. No, it's Mambo. O! Baby. They're saying, Mumble. Boogie! Behold, Noah, look! This was an omen from the start and now we have this uprising. Stop! Stop! Stop this unruly nonsense! Stop it right now! A little selfcontrol, if you please! You bring this disorder, this aberration, to the very heart of our community. Have you lost your minds? We're just having fun. Harmless fun. Harmless? It is this kind of backsliding that has brought the scarcity upon us. Excuse me, smiley. Can you speak plain penguin, please? He thinks the food shortage has something to do with me. Do you not understand that we can only survive here when we're in harmony? When you and your foreign friends lead us into your easy ways. you offend the Great 'Guin. You invite him to withhold his bounty. He rules the seasons. He giveth and he can taketh away. Wait a minute. Happy feet can't cause a famine. If thy kind of pagan display did not cause it, then what did? I think it comes from outside. Way beyond the ice. There are things out there, things we don't understand. Mysteries. Mindboggling mysteries. Mystic beings. Yeah, aliens. He's mad. No, aliens. I hear they're smart. He's insane. No, they might be smarter than all of us. Who knows? He drove the fish away, now he's ranting this rubbish! Hey, let me tell something to you. Don't touch me, you filthy vermin. Hey, watch it. And so it follows. Dissent leads to division and division leads us to doom. You, Mumble Happy Feet, must go. Hear, hear. Don't you take one step, sweetheart. You have as much right to be here as any of these daffy old fools. Norma Jean, I'll deal with this. Pa? Mumble, you must renounce your socalled friends. your peculiar thoughts, your strange ways. Memphis. If we are devout. sincere in our praise, the fish will return. But, Pa Listen, boy, I was a backslider myself. I was careless and now we're paying the price. What's this got to do with Mumble? It's why he is the way he is. There's nothing wrong with him! Face it, our son's all messed up. He's not messed up, hear me? Believe me, I know. How can you say that? Because when he was just an egg, I dropped him! Memphis. Mumble. Oh, my poor little Mumble. But, Mom, I'm perfectly fine. No. No, you're not, boy. That's right. For all our sakes, you must stop this freakiness with the feet. Your father speaks wisely. Heed his suffering heart and repent. But it just doesn't make any sense. Then your arrogance leaves us no choice! No, wait. Please, son, you can do this. It ain't so hard. Don't ask me to change, Pa, because I can't. And that, my brethren, is the end of it. You, begone! Mumble. No, Ma, it's okay. It's okay. Let me tell something to you. When I find out what's happening to the fish. I'll be back. Let me through? Let me through. Mumble, you don't have to go. Let it be. Gloria. No. No, Dad, this isn't fair. Gloria, listen to your father.

By the mystic beings. They didn't bestow it? No. Oh, come on, he don't know what he's saying. You were swimming and it just got caught around your neck. Oh, no way. He the guru. Lovelace, did you ever actually meet a mystic being? Officially? No. I knew it! It's all a lie. But this belongs to someone. If we could find them, I bet you they could take it off. Show me where you found it. I'm sure they could help us. You and me both. Two words, three syllables. What is it? You're dying? No, no, wait. Past, past, your past life. You're passing gas. Now he thinks he's an elephant seal. No, no, no. Go over the mountains. Go over the mountains! Through the land of the elephant seals. Beyond the land of the elephant seals.

Coming from someone who thinks it's cool to jig up and down really fast on the spot. like some twitchy idiot. You stubborn, hippityhoppity fool! Right back at you. Amigo, that was a good thing you do. She is going to be so much better off without you. She is going to find a good, steady guy to comfort her. and love her up real good and raise a big family.

If it's the only way to the forbidden shore, yeah. Crikey. You might come face to face with an annihilator. An alien annihilator? Too right. Cut you up as soon as look at you. Waste every living thing in their path. Could they be annihilating the fish? Every living thing. Merciless, mate. Merciless. Even if you're a whopping great whale. they drag your sorry carcass ashore. dice you up, melt you down, and turn you into fun food. One day you're a big old whale. next minute. fun food. Someone's gotta stop them. Oh, yeah? What's gonna be your approach? If I could just talk to them. Appeal to their better nature. Beauty.

What is this place? You're in heaven, Dave. Penguin heaven. Is it anywhere near Emperor Land? It's wherever you want it to be. Try the water, Dave. It's really real. I heard tell, when he finally saw aliens up close. they were just as the skua had described. Excuse me. Why are you taking our fish? Big, ugly penguins without feathers on their fat, flabby faces. Why are you taking our fish? You're kind of killing us out there. No! No, wait! Oh, my. Hello. Hello from Emperor Land. Good afternoon. Why are you taking our fish? I'm sure you don't mean to, but you're causing an awful lot of grief. Am I not making myself clear? I'm speaking plain penguin. Penguin! Don't you understand? You're stealing our fish. Oh, please, anyone, talk to me! For pity's sake, you're stealing our FIS After three days, he would lose his voice. After three months. he would all but lose his mind. So you found the fish, baby. Ma? Hi, sweetie. Ma. Fluffy, no matter what they say or do, we never stopped believing in you. So you'll be back soon, right? Hey, come on. Let him eat. Go ahead, Dave. Don't mind us. But there's plenty for everyone. It's okay, sugar. We can wait. No, no, Ma! Ma! There's lots here. Ma! Ma! Kids, you gotta see this. He's on now. Hey! Hello!

They're big and kind of ugly, but, Gloria. the things they can do. They're coming here. Oh, is that so? They'll be here soon. I think they wanna help us. So now you speak with them? Well, they don't speak penguin, but they seem to respond to this. What's he doing? You gotta be kidding me. I suggest we all do it. It really gets their attention. And why would it do that? Beats me, but it works. Hey, it's the hippityhopper. Freaky feet! Boys, boys Fluffy. Tall guy. Stretch! Amigo! So you dare come back? He says he's found aliens and they're taking our fish. He says that they're coming and we all have to do this. There be no such thing as aliens! Mumble, turn around. It's a disease. Is that from them? Yeah. But don't be afraid. I think it's a way to find me, that's all. You led them here? You turned them on your own kind? Wait a second, you just said there's no such thing as aliens. Well, there's not. But if there were, only a traitorous fool would bring them here. But they have to come. They're the ones taking our fish. They can do something about it. None but the Great 'Guin has the power to give and take away. The Great 'Guin didn't put things out of whack, the aliens did. A fool returns this day to mock our suffering. We are starving and he wants us to hippityhop. So do we hold fast to our ways. or do we bend to the fetid fantasies of a dancing fool? Say, how does that feet thing go again? Yeah, show us, Mumble.

Come on, will it harder! Now with extra added bonus will! Ow! My foot! Will it, will it, will it! Open your eyes. Ramon! Close your eyes. Where are the kids? Security! You. Me. Beautiful egg. Now. You. Me? Fat chance. I have a chance. And it's fat! Carmen, I'm getting serious stalker vibe. Carmen. Her name is Carmen. Oh, Sven. You're going to be my best friend and my best man all rolled into one. Hey, Mumble. Carmen, wait! Where you going? Erik! Carmen! Mumble, Earrik is your boy? Yes, he is. Kids. we're leaving. Uncle Mumble, no fair! Come on, all of you. Oh, no. But this place is so much fun. Erik. Let's go. I'm not going back to Emperor Land. Don't be silly. I'm staying here. What about the folks back home and how worried your mother must be? Earrik, it's best to do what your father's saying. But I don't belong there. Oh, ﬂuffy one, I want to tell to you a secret. Okay? Sometimes, when you are a little different. the world laugh at you, ja? Yeah. Think you're funny. Pointing flippers. Mmhm. Ja, well, we have a saying back in Svenland. Believe in yourself, Earrik. because Sven believe in you. Mighty Sven? Ja? Will I ever fly? Erik, please. Mumble, the boy seeks a higher truth. If you want it, you must will it. If you will it. it will be yours. Now, go. Avvw. Ciao. Ciao. Uh, son? Erik. you know, when things go wrong. running away is not the answer. Okay? You have to find within yourself a way to handle it. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. And we're all different. It's part of the job of life to find out who you are. and what you got. It may not be dancing or flying. but when you find it. it'll be all yours. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Okeydokey. Right. Sven Will! Will! Will! What is this?! It's the wave of change! The world is changing, Bill. We've got to get on the ride! By the mother of Guin. This cannot be. Whoa. Something somewhere just took a big bump. Yeah. Sounded awfully close to Emperor Land. Come on, guys. Let's pick up the pace. This is our moment, Bill. Okay. Adapt or die, my friend. Adapt? There's no telling what we might become. Fine. Be a plankton muncher all your life. But that's what we are. We're herbivores. We eat veggies. Right. So everyone else can eat us. Well, I am not prepared to be on the menu any longer. Where you going? I'm moving up the food chain. The food chain? I'm gonna go chew on something that has a face! I don't remember this. Yeah. Well, things always look different on the way back. Guess we'll have to go all the way around. But Emperor Land is straight ahead. Yeah. So why not go over that? No, no. This way is better. But shortcuts are shorter. Not always. Now, come on. It's not that far. Guys, stop! Erik. I said stop! All right. All right. We'll keep going, but take it nice and slow. And what's say we don't look down, okay? Atticus, what did I just say? Whoa! Wow. G'day, sport. Hi. Where you heading? Home. Oh, yeah? So am I. If you don't mind backing up a little bit. we'll just squeeze past. That's the one thing I Back up. The Beachmaster backs up for nobody. Then maybe. you can move sideways. Don't do sideways. We've come all the way across. You'll have to go all the way back. I've got the kids. It's kind of dangerous. Of course. And we're anxious to get home. I see. Fair enough. But see it my way, sport. One day, I'll be protecting my beach. and some pumpedup mongrel wants to take it from me. We're nosetonose. The whole world's watching. And in the back of me mind, I once backed up for a penguin. He'll see it in me eyes. and I'm gone. Goodbye, ladies. Hello, lonely beach. You with me? Yeah, but. Then get out of my way. My mother says, “Every obstacle is an opportunity. What? Bo. Bo! Whoa! Unh! Hey! Yo, dog! You be apologizing. or I'm gonna tear you a new nostril. He didn't mean that. That's okay. I didn't mean that. SvenTHINK, SvenTHINK. Erik, no! Golly gosh! You fat. mother of all bullies! Get out of my way! Oh, no. Erik. Daddy. Daddy. Where are you, Daddy? Where's he gone? Uhoh. That's not healthy. Are you okay? Not exactly. Daddy, what are you doing. down there? Get back up here. Not sure I can. There is a way. but you won't like it. You want me to back up, don't you? Come on, Dad. You can do it. We won't think less of you, Daddy. Well, I suppose technically it's just reversing. I guess I could, you know, just a smidge. That's it, Dad. That's the spirit. Yeah. Back. That's it. In no way does this feel natural. Now see if you can turn yourself around. All right. Use your flippers. Whoa! Stop! Dad! Come on, Daddy. You can do it. Oh, jeez! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Can you hear me. Daddy?! Shane? Darren? Daddy! I need youse. to stay strong. I know you will, because you've never let me down. Penguin, you still there? Yeah. Right here. Would you see that me boys get home safe to their mother? Daddy. What are you saying? Sorry, boys. They're calling full time on your old man's career. No, Dad! No! No, Dad! Come on. Take a look around. Can you see any way out? Yeah. I could grow. a pair of wings. Can you move at all? I'm stuck, mate. Okay. Everyone. back from the edge. Come on, get back from the edge. All right. Now don't move till I get back. Where are you going? To see what I can do for their daddy. What can he do? He's just an ordinary penguin. That's one small step for a krill. one giant leap for spineless invertebrates. Holy mother of krill. How's your appetite, Bill? He's a big 'un. What on earth are you doing? I'm stalking. You can't.! Shh! Shh. You can't. You can't stalk. You're a krill. We've got to evolve, Bill. Evolve? Just like that? It's taken us millions of years just to get this far. Watch and learn, Billyboy. I'm about to naturally select. No! No, no, no. Hmm. A little chewy. Keenly aromatic. You just nibbled on its butt. Don't let it go to your head. Au contraire, I will go to its head. Oh, goodness. Onward and upward, my friend. Fresh delicacies await. Uh, penguin? Is that you? Streuth. Oh, penguin. We're going where no krill has ever gone before! Uhhuh. We're the stuff of legends, Bill! Yippieyiyokiyay. How far to the face? Just ahead! Hey, you! Doofus! Yeah, you. Kelpsucker. My mistake. I thought you were a ruthless killing machine. Don't you want a little taste of penguin? Stand back, Bill. This could get messy. Ha, ha! He's a fighter! But he'll drop soon. It's just the death throes! Yoohoo! Whoa! Whoa! G'day, gorgeous. I'm sorry. My mistake. Dad? Boys. Pa. It worked. SvenTHINK. Oh, yeah! Did you see the look in his eyes? Mortal terror! You said he was finished. I spared his despicable life! What? He'll tell his friends. Spread the fear. There's a new predator in town! Sching! You're insane. Someone's gotta keep their numbers down, Bill, and we are that someone. Oh, boy. We are the champions, my friend. And we'll keep on fighting till the end. Listen to yourself. Me are the champion Me are the champion. Delusional singing! Will, it's the first sign of madness. Me are the champion. How's that shoulder? Yeah, it's okay. Yeah, get some ice on it. You'll be right. Thanks. No. Thank you. Thanks to you, chief, Beachmaster Bryan gets to play another season. I reckon that makes you an honorary elephant seal. What do you reckon, boys? Thank you, Your Honor, for giving us our daddy back. Yeah. Cheers, Bryan. I owe you one, my friend. No. I mean it. All you have to do is ask. Any time, any place. No worries. Okay? No worries. Okay. Come on, nippers. Let's get youse home. All right. Both of youse. On you hop, Shane0. Come on, guys. Go on, Daggy, up you get. We lost, ain't we? Atticus, we're not lost. Emperor Land should be right here. Yeah. My instincts are never wrong. You all are crazy. I know for a fact the Emperorhood is one day that way. No, that way. Oh, my goodness! Oh, no. Hey, look! Somebody got out! Aye, you see! I knew there was a way! Hey, buddy, how do we get out?! I don't know! I'm trying to get in! Mumble! Mumble! Yo! Dad! Atticus, my man! Good to see y'all still kicking! What happened? That big old iceberg you on came thumping and bumping, and here we are! That's messed up! Nothing we can't fix, dear! Mommy! I told them all to chillax! I knew you'd be fine! Where's Mommy? Has anyone seen Gloria? Mumble! Erik! Mom! Gloria! My beautiful boys. Thought I'd never see you again. Gotta be a way to get you out. Honey, there are search parties everywhere. If there's a way out, we're gonna find it. Don't worry, Daddy! Today Uncle Mumble got a big old elephant seal out of. a big black hole! Yeah. But that was a whole lot different! But you did. Mumble! Can you get us a couple of fish for my kids? Mine too! Over here! Okay. I'll do what I can. What about my family? Hey, don't forget us! Hey, hey! Hey, listen. There is a way to feed a whole lot of you. I'm going to Adelie Land. Bring back some friends. You'll have to be patient. okay? Bo, where are you going? I'm taking the shortcut. No, you're not. You're staying here. But I'm very fast. Erik? Be cool. She's a freerunner. Sorry, Erik. One's faster than two. Boadicea, do you have a tail feather? Yes, I have a tail feather. Then you. shake it, my dear! Booya! But, Miss Viola. there are all kinds of dangers out there. Not dangers, challenges! Now that's the spirit! Okay. Okay. Find Uncle Ramon. Tell him to bring the amigos and as many Adelies as he can. And. And always remember Just let rip! Come on, Uncle Mumble. We got some fishing to do. So, what news have you? Every nook and cranny, every which way, completely blocked. There's a lot of talk out there. Thinking the unthinkable. Yeah. Noah, they're calling this the 'Berg of Doom. How will we answer that? We look again. We can't just keep. We go back and we search a hundred times. There is no way out! A thousand times if we have to. There's always a way! Yeah, that's it, right there. The ice The ice sounds nice Check one. The ice Ice sounds nice. Here. Let me help you. Okay. Now let it go. Wait. Erik! No! Slow down! Jump! Jump off! Whoa! Did you see me? Did you? Don't ever do that again! Daddy, I was flying! Aw, Erik. Really flying! I flapped my wings super fast and I went uppityup! Son, we're penguins. We can't fly. But Sven is a penguin. I don't know what kind of penguin Sven is, but we are Emperor penguins. We can't. But if everyone could learn to fly, Mommy can. get out of there! Hey. I don't know if there's a way out! Know. way out! Hey! But if there is, it sure as eggs ain't flying. If you want it, you must will it! And if you will it, it will be yours! Aw, Erik, get real. They're trapped. They're hungry, afraid. The last thing anyone. needs is false hope! Boys? Then they'll die. Boys. what's going on with you two? Just working things out. Erik? We need some mother love, Ms. G. He's about to explode! Mumble, why don't you go. catch some fish? He ain't hungry. Ms. G. It's okay, Atticus. I got it. I got it! Okay, fishing. Erik, just let it go. Erik, calm down! Sweetie, take a step back. Close your eyes. Deep breath. Come on, it's easy. Just when you think. Hope is lost. And giving UP ls all you got. Blue turns black. Your confidence is cracked. There seems no turnin' back from here. When your feet. Are made of stone. And you're convinced. That you're all alone. Look at the stars. Instead of the dark. You'll find your heart. Shines like the sun. Let's not let our anger get us lost. And the need to be right. Comes with way too high a cost. That's when you can build. A bridge of light. That's what turns the wrongs all right. That's when you know. It's worth the fight. That's when love Turns nighttime. Into day. That's when loneliness goes away. That's why you gotta be strong This night 'Cause only love can build us. A bridge or light Deep breath, take it. On the chin. But don't forget. To let love back in. That's when love can build. A bridge of light. That's what turns the wrongs all right. That's when you can't. Give up the fight. And that's when love Turns nighttime into day. That's when loneliness goes away. That's why you gotta. Be strong tonight 'Cause only love can build us. A bridge of light. Only love can build us. A bridge of light. Only love can build us. A bridge of light Will? Will? Hm? You asleep yet? Mmhm. Deeply. Well, Is that the swarm or am I dreaming? You're dreaming. Wow, how wonderful. I wonder if they're edible. Aww. Will, don't you long for the patter of a thousand tiny little feet? I, for one, don't have the means to bring up so many kids. The birthday presents alone. I've already Phil, Jill, Lill, Gill, Hil, Billy, Lilly, Willy. All right. Wilma, Willis, Wilbur, Wilhelmina. I get the picture. And there's even a Will. Good for you. We could start a little swarm. We're both males. We'll adopt. You adopt, I'll adapt. I've got slaughtering to do. Fine, that's just fine! Off you go then. Quench your blood lust. There's plenty more krill in the sea. Plenty of krill would count themselves lucky to have me as a partner. I'm a heck of a wingman! Will. Will? Hey. Hey. You're all the swarm I've got. Suit yourself. But no hankypanky. Are you hurt? No, I'm good. I'm okay. It's okay. Aw, come on, Seymour, take a break. No. No, no, thanks, brother. My boy is out there. Oh, no. Erik! Atticus! Take cover! Come on, Erik. Over here. Waddle, waddle, waddle. Oh, if only I could fly! Boohoohoo! Oh, look at this. My alltime favorite. Doomed penguin packed in ice. All you can eat. Forever. I've never seen so many skuas in one place. Stand together. Hold fast. They know. They sense it! We're never getting out of here! They're scavengers. Cowards! They prey only on the weak. Admit it, Noah! We're all dead meat! No! We are Emperor penguins! Quite right! Though we stare famine in the face, we will not yield! Ha, ha! Though imprisoned. on every side by colossal walls of ice. we will not be broken! Yes, sir. Speak on it, Noah! We are fortitude! We are bold defiance! We are one glorious Emperor nation! No! Erik, stay down! Mumble? They're okay. Gloria, behind you! Hey!

I wouldn't want you to get cold feet, my darling. I am not your darling. See? What did I tell you? No backbone. All squishy. Hey, back off! I'm a Carmenonly facility. Ramon, it's incredible. Everybody came. Except for that guy who stayed, he had the sniffles. Oh, no, he's here. You're a true friend. Thank you. I had nothing to do with it. Well, then, Lovelace, thank you so much.

They call him Sven. He's Sventastic. Let me revert back to what I previously said before. Ow! You're an idiot. And guess what. What? He can carry more fish than any penguin that ever. existed. Wow. And it's all due to his amazingly large red beak. Impressive. Sven? Sven? Ja? Ja? There's someone down there who's very special. And knowing Gloria, she won't eat. until everyone else has been fed. Aww. Do you think you could take this down to her? Yeah, don't be silly. Where is he? No, she. Oh. There, surrounded by the children. That is your spouse? Yes. Your spouse? Wow. Here. The fish. Oh, no, no, Mumbley. She deserves the very best. A la carte. A la me! So you want some music? Nope. Let's have some music. Awake me up before you gogo. Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo. Awake me up before you gogo. Can you keep it down? I wanna hit that high. Just be quiet! Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm never gonna give you up. Never gonna let you down. Whoa! A predator convention? Oh, no. Why wasn't I invited? Will. Guys? Guys. Will, don't go. Get off. You'll never survive. Please. Will? Stop! I think we should split up. Oh, well, I mean, if it's personal space you want, how's that? No, no. I mean, really split up. But why? Ah, Bill, this is my life now. I can change. Be smaller, invisible. See? You're gonna be just fine. I'll see you around, kiddo. Will? Please. Don't leave me.

Kind of busy. Oh, you're funny! Whoo! She is a hottie! Honey, are you okay? Are you sure he's not related to Ramon'? Oh, you're funny! You shouldn't make fun of someone just because they're different. Especially someone who's come all this way. to save us. You're right. And when Sven teaches everyone to fly. It'll be upuppityup. And out of there. You'll see. Hey, who turned off the fish? Hey, guys! What's happening to the fish? Yoohoo! Fishy friends! What is problem? The birdeaters! Svensei! You must fly on the wings of hope. and summon them to the aid of our Emperor brothers! You know, I would love to, but I just hurt my tongue. No. What? Ciao. Hmm. Interesting. Someone better do something. They're not stopping. Don't worry. I know exactly how to get the attention. of our alien benefactors. Calm down. Deep breath. Deep breath. Lovelace! Mumble, my man! I'm the mayor me! This is great. Ah. Can you believe this? Where's there a Will, there's a way out! Hm? Huh? Bill? Is that you? I don't know, Uncle Mumble. They're noisy and they're messing with our ice. Atticus, they're building us a way out of here. ATTICUS Oh. Everybody who said we'd never get out of here, take a look! That's our ice road to freedom. It won't be long now, boys. I'll miss this place. So where will we live when everybody gets out? We'll find somewhere new, sweetheart. It's a big world. As long as we're together, we already home. Yeah. Come on, everyone. Huddle up. Oh, no, no, no! Carmen, can't you see? Even nature decrees that we be close together. Mm. Yeah. No, no, no. Oh, you are still here. And you're still here. They're gone. What? A little bad weather, they're gone! What's going on? Who's gone? The aliens! What? All of this flipperizing for nothing! Our alien benefactors. have abandoned us! They have abandoned us! Everybody! Everybody! The sea is frozen over, ja? Impossible for aliens to return! Too much icey. Too much icey. If the sea so far away, how we gonna catch food? Yeah, what's the point of us starving too? I guess we should be going. We can't just leave them. I think they're leaving. Who's leaving? It appears that we. What is he saying? I regret to inform. we are no longer in the catering businesses. Then who will bring us fish? Some good questions have no good answers. Sven, they can't leave! Not now! I so sorry, fluffy one. If they stay. then they, too, become not alive. Ah! I can't take it! I can't take it any more! Out of my way! I'm getting out of here! Whoa, that guy was crazy. Yeah. So am I. Come on, girls.

One. Two. Ramon, you're crazy! Carmen! I'm coming! My name is Ramon. Ramon Carlos Garcia Santa Maria La Niña Pinta Pacifico. Ramon. I can't believe you did this. How could I not? But down here, we're doomed. A thousand lifetimes up there is nothing to this one exquisite moment by your side. You are my world entire. You're beautiful. Only on the outside. No! Why didn't I see this before? You're really beautiful. You really think so? Absolutely. Ramon, my fallen angel. You chased me until I caught you. Ay, Ramon, the earth is moving. I know. It's amazing. No, it's moving for real. Move! Move! Keep going. Don't look back. Mumble, that thing's on the edge! Keep trying! All it needs is a nudge! We can do this! Okay. It's just not enough. Not enough. Uh, Mumbley. We're not big enough. Yeah. My feet hurt. Excuse me. Mumbley. Mumbley. Yeah? There's a guy named Lars Gavunsterson. I used to dance with his sister Girta, and I. Well, anyway, we were twotime national champion. Oh. Oh, okay. Amateur division, so. Um. Look, could I give it a shot? Sure, sure. Of course. Attentions! Attentions. everybody! Mumbley's foot is very, very hurty. Yeah, like your brain. But I have song and dance. from my homelands. It's in Svenish, so join in as best you can. Okay! And anooney, and adooney and avooney! Get off! Come on! Help! Come on, son. Come on. Where are we going? To find us a lot more oomph. Where am I? Who turned out the lights? Is this the end? I should make out my will. I, Willy Williams, leave everything to my imagination. Oh, no. Imagination, it's the second sign of madness. If only I'd listened to Bill. Oh, Bill. I'm so sorry! That's okay, Will. You were right. I should have stayed with the swarm. No. You were right. Oh, great! I'm talking to myself. You're not mad, Will. Now I'm seeing things. What's going on inside my head?! Will? Please, make it stop! Will! Ow! Bill? Is it really you? Well, there's only one of me in all the world. You taught me that. Aw, Bill! What are the chances? About one in a krillion, Will. Quiet, you two. I'm trying to sleep. Hey, everyone! It's Will! Wow, it's him! It's wee Willy Williams! I thought he'd be taller. He's back! Will's back! Welcome home, Will. But how did you find them? They found me. I was on my last nine legs. I was such a fool, Bill. Will, you're a legend. Those days are gone, my friend. The carnivore is over. No. It's because of you we're all here. It is? I told them how the world really works. How there were predators, how we had to adapt. I led them here, under the great ice. No one can find us here. But we're still at the bottom of the food chain with no significant purpose. Well, we all have a purpose. Yours is to change the world. What possible difference. could one krill make? Wait and see, Will. You wait and see. What are you looking at? What are you looking at? Don't know, but it sure is ugly. Notice, boys, the witty riposte as weapon? Right. Outside, now! We are outside. Come on, then. No. you come on. Excuse me. Bryan? Down here. Ah, g'day, chief. What are you doing here? Bryan, I need a favor. A big one. For you, champ, anything. I need you to come to Emperor Land. Bring as many of your kind as you can. Why? To dance. You know. Now, why would I wanna do that? To free the penguin nation. Oh, yeah? There's been a catastrophe. Right. The entire population is trapped. Uhhuh. By huge walls of ice and snow. Hey! Bryan! Look, I'd love to help you, sport, but you've come at the worst possible time. Maybe after winter or something, okay? No, that's too late. Way too late. Bryan! You gonna fight or what? You said you owe me one. But right now, I got problems of me own. Everyone's cranky, looking for biff. The multitudes need me to keep the peace. If you don't come now, multitudes will die. Here we go. You saying it's my fault now? Whatever's happening to you penguins. don't blame it on me. I'm not. But you can help save them. Listen, fella, you look after your kind, and I'll look after mine. If I thought like that, I would have left you in that hole. That's it, I'm claiming a forfeit. Get off my beach! Wayne, now I'm really gonna hurt you. I saved your life! And I'm gonna save yours.
