No one is getting replaced. Now, let's all be polite and give whatever it is up there. a nice, big Andy'sroom welcome. Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. Come in, Star Command. Star Command, come in. Do you read me? Why don't they answer? My ship! Blast! This'll take weeks to repair. Buzz Lightyear mission log, stardate 4072. My ship has run off course en route to sector 12. I've crashlanded on a strange planet. The impact must've awoken me from hypersleep. Terrain seems a bit unstable. No readout yet if the air is breathable. And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere. Hello! Whoa! HeHey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Did I frighten you? Didn't mean to. Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody. and this is Andy's room. That's all I wanted to say. And also, there has been a bit of a mixup. This is my spot, see. the bed here. Local law enforcement. It's about time you got here. I'm Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit. My ship has crashlanded here by mistake. Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed here is my spot. I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystallic fusion? Well, let's see. We got doubleA's. Watch yourself! Halt! Who goes there? Don't shoot! It's okay. Friends. Do you know these lifeforms? Yes. They're Andy's toys. All right, everyone. You're clear to come up. I am Buzz Lightyear. I come in peace. Oh, I'm so glad you're not a dinosaur! All right, thank you. Now, thank you all for your kind welcome. Say, what's that button do? I'll show you. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue. Wow! Hey, Woody's got something like that. His is a pull string, only it's. Only it sounds like a car ran over it. Oh, yeah, but not like this one. This is a quality sound system. Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, uh, where you from? Singapore? Hong Kong? Well, no. Actually, lI'm. I'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four. As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion. from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance. Oh, really? I'm from Playskool. And I'm from Mattel. Well, I'm not really from Mattel. I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout. You'd think they'd never seen a new toy before. Well, sure, look at him. He's got more gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife. Ah, ah, ah, ah! Please be careful. You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off. Hey, a laser! How come you don't have a laser, Woody? It's not a laser. It's a. It's a little light bulb that blinks. What's with him? Laser envy. All right, that's enough! Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy. Toy? TOY. TOY! Excuse me. lI think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger. The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's preschool toys present. Gettin' kind of tense, aren't ya? Oh, uh, Mr. Lightyear, uh, now, I'm curious. What does a Space Ranger actually do? He's not a Space Ranger! He doesn't fight evil or. or shoot lasers or fly! Excuse me. Wow! Oh, impressive wingspan. Very good! Oh, what? What? These are plastic. He can't fly. They are a terilliumcarbonic alloy, and I can fly. No, you can't. Yes, I can. You can't. Can. Can't. Can't. Can't! I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed! Okay, then, Mr. Light Beer, prove it. All right, then, I will. Stand back, everyone. To infinity and beyond! Can! Whoa! Oh, wow! You flew magnificently! I found my movin' buddy. Thank you. ThThank you all. Thank you. That wasn't flying. That was falling with style. Man, the dolls must really go for you. Can you teach me that? Golly bob howdy! Oh, shut up! No, in a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was. They'll see. They'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy. I was on top of the world livin' high It was right in my pocket Whoa! I was livin'the life Things were just the way they should be When from out of the sky like a bomb Comes some little punk in a rocket Now all of a sudden some strange things are happening to me Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Strange things Are happening to me Strange things Strange things Are happening to me Ain't no doubt about it I had friends I had lots of friends Now all my friends are gone And I'm doin' the best I can To carry on I had power Power I was respected Respected But not anymore And I've lost the love of the one Whom I adore Let me tell you 'bout it Strange things Are happening to me Strange things Strange things Are happening to me Ain't no doubt about it Strange things Strange things Oh! Finally. Hey, who's got my hat? Look, I'm Woody. Howdy, howdy, howdy. Ahha. Ahha! Give me that! Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog, let me show you something. It looks as though I've been accepted into your culture. Your chief, Andy, inscribed his name on me. Wow! With permanent ink too! Well, I must get back to repairing my ship. Don't let it get to you, Woody. Uh, let what? I don't, uh. What do you mean? Who? I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know he'll always have a special place for you. Yeah, like the attic. All right! That's it! Unidirectional bonding strip. Mr. Lightyear wants more tape. Listen, Light Snack, you stay away from Andy. He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me. What are you talking about? Where's that bonding strip? Stop with this spaceman thing! It's getting on my nerves! Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? Ohhoho! Okay! Ooh, well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh? Don't even think about it, cowboy. Oh, yeah, tough guy? The air isn't toxic. How dare you open a spaceman's helmet on an uncharted planet! My eyeballs could've been sucked from their sockets. You actually think you're The Buzz Lightyear? Oh, all this time I thought it was an act! Hey, guys, look! It's the real Buzz Lightyear! You're mocking me, aren't you? Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Buzz, look! An alien! Where? Yes! Whoa! Uhoh. It's Sid! Don't move! I thought he was at summer camp. They, uh, must have kicked him out early this year. Oh, no, not Sid! Incoming! Who is it this time? Uh, I can't. I can't tell. Hey, where's Lenny? Right here, Woody. Oh, no, I can't bear to watch one of these again. Stay where you are! Oh, no, it's a Combat Carl. What's going on? Nothing that concerns you spacemen Just us toys. I'd better take a look anyway. Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device? That's why. Sid. Hmm, sure is a hairy fellow. No, no, that's Scud, you idiot. That is Sid. You mean that happy child? That ain't no happy child. He tortures toys, just for fun! Well, then, we've got to do something. What are you doing? Get down from there! I'm gonna teach that boy a lesson. Yeah, sure. You go ahead. Melt him with your scary laser. Be careful with that. It's extremely dangerous. He's lighting it! He's lighting it! Hit the dirt! Look out! Yes! He's gone! He's history! I could've stopped him. Buzz, I would love to see you try. Of course, I'd love to see you as a crater. Yeah! The sooner we move, the better. Oh, what a great shot. Yeah! To infinity and beyond! Oh, all this packing makes me hungry. What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet? Pizza Planet? Oh, cool! Go wash your hands, and I'll get Molly ready. Can I bring some toys? You can bring one toy. Just one? One toy? Will Andy pick me? Don't count on it? Ohh! Buzz! Oh, Buzz! Buzz Lightyear! Buzz Lightyear, thank goodness! We've got trouble! Trouble? Where? Down there. Just down there. A helpless toy! It's. It's trapped, Buzz! Then we've no time to lose. I don't see anything. Uh, he's there. Just. Just keep looking. What kind of toy. Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! I don't see him in the driveway. Did you see what happened? I think he bounced into Sid's yard! Ohh! Buzz! Hey, everyone! R.C.'s trying to say something. What is it, boy? He's saying that this was no accident. Huh? What do you mean? I mean HumptyDumpty was pushed. No! By Woody! What? What? Wait a minute. You. You don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, Do you? Potato Head? That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you backstabbin' murderer! Now, it was an accident, guys. Come on. Now, you. you gotta believe me. We believe ya, Woody. Right, Rex? Well, ye. n. I don't like confrontations. Where is your honor, dirt bag? You are an absolute disgrace! You don't deserve to. Hey! You couldn't handle Buzz cuttin' in on your playtime, could you, Woody? Didn't wanna face the fact that Buzz just might be Andy's new favorite toy. So you got rid of him. Well, what if Andy starts playing with me more, Woody, huh? You're gonna knock me out of the window too? I don't think we should give him the chance. There he is, men. Frag him! Let's string him up by his pull string! I've got dibs on his hat! Would you boys stop it? Tackle him! No, no, no! WWWait! Boys, stop it! I can explain everything. Okay, Mom, be right down. I've gotta get Buzz. Retreat! Mom, do you know where Buzz is? No, I haven't seen him. Psst! Andy, I'm heading out the door! But, Mom, I can't find him! Honey, just grab some other toy. Now, come on. Okay. I couldn't find my Buzz. I know I left him right there. Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him. It's too short! We need more monkeys! There aren't any more! That's the whole barrel! Buzz, the monkeys aren't working. We're formulating another plan! Stay calm! Oh, where could he be? Can I help pump the gas? Sure! I'll even let you drive. Yeah? Yeah, when you're 16. Yuk, yuk, yuk. Funny, Mom. Oh, great. How am I gonna convince those guys it was an accident? Buzz! Buzz! Hah! You're alive! This is great! Oh, I'm saved! I'm saved! Andy will find you here. He'll take us back to the room, and then you can tell everyone. that this was all just a big mistake. Huh? Right? Buddy? I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet. Oh. Oh, that's good. But we're not on my planet. Are we? No. Okay. Come on! You want a piece of me? Ow! Buzz. Buzz. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue. Ouch! Next stop. Pizza Planet. Yeah! Andy! Wh. Doesn't he realize that I'm not there? I'm lost! Oh, I'm a lost toy!

Sheriff, this is no time to panic. This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost! Andy is gone! They're gonna move from their house in two days, and it's all your fault! My. My fault? If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place. Oh, yeah? Well, if you hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship. and taken away everything that was important to me. Don't talk to me about importance. Because of you, the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy! What? What are you talking about? Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, Emperor Zurg has been secretly building. a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet! I alone have information that reveals this weapon's only weakness. And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command! You are a toy! You aren't the real Buzz Lightyear! You're a. Uh, you're an action figure! You are a child's plaything! You are a sad, strange little man, and you have my pity. Farewell. Oh, yeah? Well, good riddance, ya loony. Rendezvous with Star Command. Hey, gas dude! You talking to me? Pizza Planet? Yeah, man. Can you help me? D'you know where Cutting Boulevard is? Andy! Just a moment. Oh, no!

Um, like, the pizzas are getting cold here. Oh, yeah, Cutting Boulevard. Yeah, yeah. Which way? Now, you're sure this space freighter will return. to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply? Uhhuh. And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you home. Well, then, let's climb aboard. No, no, no, wait! Buzz! Buzz! Let's get in the back. No one will see us there. Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. We'll be much safer in the cockpit. Yeah, but. Buzz! Buzz! That's two lefts and a right, huh? Yeah. Uh, thanks for the directions, okay? Yeah, remember, kid. Buzz! It's safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay. What an idiot. Next shuttle lift off scheduled for Tminus 30 minutes and counting. You are cleared to enter. Welcome to Pizza Planet. The white zone is for eating pizza. Sheriff! Sheriff? There you are. Now, the entrance is heavily guarded. We need a way to get inside. Great idea, Woody. I like your thinkin'.

Ooh! Greetings. I am Buzz Lightyear. I come in peace. Tell me what it's like outside. Before your space journey, reenergize yourself with a slice of pepperoni, now boarding at counter three. This is an intergalactic emergency. I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12. Who's in charge here? The claw! The claw is our master. The claw chooses who will go and who will stay. This is ludicrous. Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there? Take that! Oh, no! Sid! Get down! What's gotten into you, Sheriff? I wa. You are the one. That decided to climb into this. Shh! The claw. It moves. I have been chosen! Farewell, my friends. I go on to a better place. Gotcha! A Buzz Lightyear? No way! Yes! Buzz! No! Hey! He has been chosen. He must go. Hey! You might anger the claw. What are you doing? Stop it! The claw! The claw! Stop it, you zealots! Do not fight the claw. All right! Double prizes! Let's go home and play. Sheriff, I can see your dwelling from here.

Mayday, mayday. Come in, Star Command. Send reinforcements. Star Command, do you copy? I've set my laser from stun to kill. Ah, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us, we can blink 'em to death. Hey, you guys, I think I found him. Buzz, is that you? Whiskers, will you get out of here! You're interfering with a search and rescue! Look! They're home. Mom, have you seen Woody? Where was the last place you left him? Right here in the van. I'm sure he's there. You're just not looking hard enough. He's not here, Mom. Woody's gone! Woody's gone? Yeah, boy, the weasel ran away. Huh? Huh? I told you he was guilty. Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities? Oh, Slink, I hope he's okay. Oh, a survivor! Where's the rebel base? Talk! I can see your will is strong. Well, we have ways of making you talk. Where are your rebel friends now? Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready! All right! Are you all right? I'm proud of you, Sheriff. A lesser man would've talked under such torture. I sure hope this isn't permanent. Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport. The door. It's open! We're free! Woody, we don't know what's out there! I'll tell you wha. They're gonna eat us, Buzz! Do something, quick! Shield your eyes! It's not working.

Andy's house, Sid's house. What's the difference? Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. YYou must not be thinking clearly. No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. I'm not a Space Ranger. I'm just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy. Whoa. Hey. Wait a minute. Being a toy is a lot better than being a, a Space Ranger. Yeah, right. No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal. It's because you're a toy. You are his toy. But why would Andy want me? Why would Andy want you? Look at you! You're a Buzz Lightyear! Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you. You've got wings! You glow in the dark! You talk! Your helmet does that. that. that whoosh thing. You are a cool toy. As a matter of fact, you're too cool. I mean. I mean, what chance does a toy like me have. against a Buzz Lightyear action figure? All I can do is. There's a snake in my boots! Why would Andy ever want to play with me when he's got you? I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket. Listen, Buzz, forget about me. You should get out of here while you can. Buzz, what are you doin'? I thought you. Come on, Sheriff. There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing. Hit it!

Buzz Lightyear mission log. All signs point to this planet as the location of Zurg's fortress, but there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere. Come to me, my prey. To infinity and beyond! So, we meet again, Buzz Lightyear, for the last time. Not today, Zurg! No, no, no, no. Oh, you almost had him. I'm never gonna defeat Zurg! Sure, you will, Rex. In fact, you're a better Buzz than I am. But look at my little arms! I can't press the fire button and jump at the same time! Where is it? Where is it? Woody? Hang on, cowboy! Woody, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, Buzz. Okay. Here's your list of things to do while I'm gone. Batteries need to be changed. Toys in the bottom of the chest need to be rotated. Oh, and make sure everyone attends Mr. Spell's seminar on what to do if you or a part of you is swallowed. Okay? Okay. Good. Okay. Woody, you haven't found your hat yet, have you? No! And Andy's leaving for cowboy camp any minute, and I can't find it anywhere! Don't worry, Woody. In just a few hours, you'll be sitting around a campfire with Andy making delicious, hot sch'moes. They're called s'mores, Buzz. Right. Right. Of course. Has anyone found Woody's hat yet? Keep looking, men. Dig deeper! Negatory. Still searching. The lawn gnome next door says it's not in the yard, but he'll keep lookin'. It's not in Molly's room. We've looked everywhere. I found it. You found my hat? Your hat? No. The missus lost her earring. Oh, my little sweet potato! Oh, you found it! Oh, it's so nice to have a big, strong spud around the house. Oh, great. That's just great. This'll be the first year I miss cowboy camp, all because of my stupid hat! Woody, look under your boot. Don't be silly. My hat is not under my boot. Would you just look? No hat. Just the word Andy. And the boy who wrote that would take you to camp with or without your hat. I'm sorry, Bo. It's just that I've been lookin' forward to this all year. It's my one time with just me and Andy. You're cute when you care. Bo, not in front of Buzz. Let him look. Miss Peep, your sheep! This is Al from Al's Toy Barn, and I'm sittin' on good deals. Whoa! I think I'm feeling a deal hatching right now. Whoa! Let's see what we got. We got boats for a buck, Beanies for a buck.. Turn it off! Someone's gonna hear! Which one is off? Buck, buck, buck! And that's cheap, cheap, cheap! So hurry on down. For cryin' out loud, it's this one. I despise that chicken. Fellas! Fellas! Okay, I got some good news, and I got some bad news. What news? The good news is I found your hat, Woody. My hat! Slink, thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Where'd you find it? Well, that's the bad news. Oh, it's Buster! Canine alert! Man your battle stations! Let's move, move, move! Woody! Hide! Quick! Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay! You found me! Buster, all right. Hey, how did he do, Hamm? Looks like a new record. Okay, boy. Sit. Reach for the sky. Gotcha! Great job, boy. Who's gonna miss me while I'm gone, huh? Who's gonna miss me? Andy, you got all your stuff? Have a good weekend, everybody. I'll see you Sunday night. It's in my room. Stick 'em up. I guess we'll work on that later. Hey, Woody. Ready to go to cowboy camp? Andy, honey, come on. Five minutes, and we're leavin'. Five minutes. Help, help! Somebody help me! Let her go, evil Dr Pork Chop! Never! You must choose, Sheriff Woody. How shall she die? Shark, or death by monkeys? Choose! I choose Buzz Lightyear! What? That's not a choice! To infinity and beyond! I'll save you, Miss Peep. My hero. Thanks, Buzz. No problem, buddy. You should never tangle with the unstoppable duo of Woody and Buzz Lightyear! Oh, no. Andy, let's go! Molly's already in her car seat. But, Mom, Woody's arm ripped. Oh, no. Maybe we can fix him on the way. No, just leave him. I'm sorry, honey, but you know toys don't last forever. What happened? Woody's been shelved. Andy! Woody? Woody? Honey, are you okay? Yeehaw! Ride 'em, cowboy! He's back? Hey, everybody! Andy's back! He's back early from cowboy camp! Places, everybody! Andy's coming! Yeah! Hey, Woody! Did you miss me? Giddyap, giddyap, giddyap. Ride 'em, cowboy! I forgot. You're broken. I don't wanna play with you any more. No, Andy! No. No, Andy! No! Andy. Andy. Bye, Woody. No! No! Andy! Wheezy, is that you? Hey, Woody. What are you doing up here? I thought Mom took you to get your squeaker fixed months ago. Andy was so upset. Nah. She just told him that to calm him down and then put me on the shelf. Why didn't you yell for help? Well, I tried squeakin'. But I'm still broken. No one could hear me. Besides, the dust aggravates my condition. What's the point in prolonging the inevitable? We're all just one stitch away from here to there. Yard sale? Yard sale! Yard sale! Guys, wake up, wake up! There's a yard sale outside! Yard sale? Sarge, emergency roll call! Sir, yes, sir! Red alert! All civilians fall in position now! Single file! Let's move, move, move! Hamm? Here.

Careful on the steps, now. Okay, boy. Let's go. And keep it casual. Not that casual. Piggy bank coming through, coming through. Is he out there? There he is. He's getting in the box! He's sellin' himself for 25 cents! Woody, you're worth more than that. Hold on. Hold on. He's got something. It's Wheezy! Wheezy? Hey, it's not suicide. It's a rescue. Good boy, Buster. Hold still.

Hand her the sheriff. Nice and easy. $5. I'm sorry. It's an old family toy. Nowjust walk away. Wait. The other way. I'll give you 50 bucks for it. 50 bucks ain't bad. It's not for sale.

What is it, Buzz? What's happening? What's he doing? I can't watch! Can someone cover my eyes? He's stealin' Woody! What? He can't take Woody. It's illegal. Where's he going? Do something. Buzz! Get him, Buzz. Where's the red jacket? Why would someone steal Woody? All right. Let's review this one more time. Exhibit A, Woody, was kidnapped. Exhibit B, a composite sketch of the kidnapper. He didn't have a beard like that. Fine. Etch, give him a shave. The kidnapper was bigger than that. Oh, picky, picky, picky. Let's just go straight to Exhibit F. The kidnapper's vehicle. Now, the vehicle fled the scene in this direction. Your eyes are in backwards. It went the other way. Hey. Put a cork in it. How do you spell FBI? My crime scene! Oh, why don't you watch where you're going, Godspilla? I didn't know there was a crime scene. Excuse me. Excuse me. A little quiet, please. Thank you. Lazy toy brain. Lousy try, Brian. What are you doing, Buzz? It's some sort of message encoded on that vehicle's I.D. tag. Liz try bran. It's just a licence plate. It's just a jumble of letters. Yeah, and there are about 3.5 million registered cars in the tricounty area alone. Lou's thigh burn. Oh, this can't help. Let's leave Buzz to play with his toys. Toy. Toy. Toy. Hold on! Al's Toy Barn. Al's Toy Barn! Etch, draw that man in a chicken suit. It's the chicken man! That's our guy. I knew there was something I didn't like about that chicken. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be right there. And we're gonna do this commercial in one take, do you hear me, because I am in the middle of something really important. You, my little cowboy friend, are gonna make me big buck, buck, bucks. Andy! I can't believe I have to drive all the way to work on a Saturday. All the way to work! What? Whoa! Hey! Stop! Horsey, stop! Stop! Sit, boy! Stop it! Sit, I said! Whoa! Whoa. Yeehaw! It's you! It's you! It's you! It's you! It's you! It's really you! What's me? There's a snake in my boot. It is you! Please stop saying that. Prospector said someday you'd come. Sweet mother ofAbraham Lincoln! The Prospector! He'll wanna meet ya! Say hello to the Prospector! It. It's a box. He's mint in the box. Never been opened. Turn me around, Bullseye, so I can see. Why, the prodigal son has returned. Yeehaw! It's you! It's you! You're here! It's you! It's you! It's you! Okay. I'm officially freakedout now. Oh, we've waited countless years for this day. It's good to see you, Woody. Listen. I don't know. Hey, how do you know my name? Everyone knows your name, Woody. Why, you don't know who you are, do you? Bullseye? That's me. Wow. Holy cow. Cowboy Crunchies, the cereal that's sugarfrosted and dipped in chocolate, proudly presents.

It doesn't seem to be on any of these stations. Keep looking. You're going too slow. Let me take the wheel. It's too fast. How can you even tell what's on? I can tell. Stop! Back, back, back! Too late. I'm in the 40s. Got to go 'round the horn. It's faster. Back, back! Stop! And look for the giant chicken! Now, Etch! That's where I need to go. You can't go, Buzz. You'll never make it there. Woody once risked his life to save me. I couldn't call myself his friend if I weren't willing to do the same. So who's with me? I'm packing you an extra pair of shoes and your angry eyes just in case. This is for Woody when you find him. All right, but I don't think it'll mean the same coming from me. Mr. Buzz Lightyear, you just gotta save my pal Woody. I'll do my best, son. Okay, fellas. Let's roll. Geronimo! You'd think with all my video game experience, I'd be feeling more prepared. The idea is to let go. We'll be back before Andy gets home. Don't talk to any toy you don't know! To Al's Toy Barn and beyond! They don't call this the old abandoned mine for nothin', Prospector. I reckon we oughta get outta here. Where's my gold? Hold on. I'll light me a candle. This sure is a fastburnin' wick. Blast us to smithereens! That there's dynamite! Holy tarnation. I'll call for help. Hey, critters, go get Sheriff Woody. Now scurry! Good job, Bullseye. I reckon the new schoolhouse is finally done. What's that? Jessie and Prospector are trapped in the old abandoned mine, and Prospectorjust lit a stick of dynamite thinkin' it was a candle, and now they're about to be blown to smithereens? Ride like the wind, Bullseye! You're fannin' the flames, Jessie! It takes brains to put out that fire. My biscuits are burnin'! Will Woody and Bullseye land to safety? Can they reach Jessie and Stinky Pete in time? Tune in next week for the exciting conclusion, Woody's Finest Hour. All right! All right! Next tape! Hey, wait. What happened? What happens next? Come on! Let's see the next episode! That's it. What? The show was cancelled after that. Wait. What about the gold mine and the cute little critters and the dynamite? That was a great show! I mean, why cancel it? Two words, Sputnik. Once the astronauts went up, children only wanted to play with space toys. I know how that feels. But, still, my own show. I mean, look at all this stuff! Didn't you know? Why, you're valuable property?! I wish the guys could see this. Heyhowdyhey. That's me. I'm on a yoyo. Oh, hey. Nice teeth. And yet still a goodlookin' guy. Oh, it's a bank! Cool.

We're being sold to the Konishi Toy Museum in Tokyo. That's in Japan! Japan? No, no, no, no, no. I can't go to Japan. What do you mean? I got to get back home to my owner, Andy. Hey, look, look. See? He still has an owner. Oh, my goodness. No. Can't go. I can't do storage again. I just can't! Jessie. Jessie. I won't go back in the dark! What's the matter? What's wrong with her? Well, we've been in storage for a long time waiting for you. Why me? The museum's only interested in the collection if you're in it, Woody. Without you, we go back into storage. It's that simple. It's not fair! How can you do this to us? Hey, look. I'm sorry, but this is all a big mistake. You see, I was in this yard sale. Yard sale? Why were you in a yard sale if you have an owner? Well, I wasn't supposed to be there. I was trying to save another toy when. Was it because you're damaged? Did this Andy break you? Yeah, but. No, no, no, no, no! It was. It was an accident. I mean. Sounds like he really loves you. It's not like that, okay? And I'm not going to any museum! Well, I'm not going back into storage! Al's coming! Go! Go on, Jessie. Jessie, look at me. I promise you'll come out of the box. Now go! Go! It's show time! Oh, money, baby. Money, money, money. And now the main attraction. No! His arm! Where's his arm? No. No, no, no, no! What am I gonna do? I know. I know. Come on! Come on! Come on! Pick up the phone! Hello? It's me. It's Al. I got an emergency. I'm busy. Yes, we're all busy. Look. It has to be tonight. All right. All right. But first thing in the morning. It's gone! I can't believe it! My arm is completely gone! All right. Come here. Let me see that. Oh, it's just a popped seam, easily repaired. You should consider yourself lucky. Lucky? Are you shrinkwrapped? I am missing my arm! Big deal. Let him go. I'm sure his precious Andy is dying to play with a onearmed cowboy doll. Why, Jessie, you know he wouldn't last an hour on the streets in his condition. It's a dangerous world out there for a toy. All right. Nobody look till I get my cork back in. Good work, men. Two blocks down and only 19 more to go. What? Nineteen? Are we gonna do this all night? My parts are killing me. Come on, fellas. Did Woody give up when Sid had me strapped to a rocket? No. No. And did he give up when you threw him out of the back of that moving van? Oh, you had to bring that up. No, he didn't! We have a friend in need, and we will not rest until he's safe in Andy's room! Now let's move out! And that concludes our broadcast day. Bullseye. Bullseye, go, go, go, go. Come on. You don't wanna help me. I'm the bad guy. You're gonna go back in storage because of me, remember? Just go. Bullseye. All right. All right. But you have got to keep quiet. Come on. Over here. Attaboy. Okay, Bullseye. Upsydaisy. Bullseye. Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it, Bullseye. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Woody's Roundup Come on, it's time to play No, Officer! I swear. What? Get in there. There you go. Cheap case. Where is the remote? Where is the remote? Why don't I put it in the same place every. Oh, here it is. What is your problem? Look, I'm sorry I can't help you guys out. Really, I am. But you didn't have to go and pull a stunt like that. What? You think I did that? Oh, right, right. The TVjust happened to turn on, and the remote magically ended up in front of you! You calling me a liar? Well, if the boot fits. Say that again. If the boot fits. Okay, cowboy. How do you like that? Take it back! Take it back! Don't think just 'cause you're a girl, I'm gonna take it easy on you. Jessie, Woody, you stop this at once. I don't know how that television turned on, but fighting about it isn't helping anything. If I had both my arms. The fact is, you don't, Woody, so I suggest you just wait until morning. The cleaner will come, fix your arm. And then I'm outta here! Oh, no, no. Bullseye, don't take it that way. It's just that Andy. Andy, Andy, Andy. That's all he ever talks about. Hey, Buzz, can we slow down? May I remind you that some of us are carrying over $6 in change? Losing health units. Must rest. Is everyone present and accounted for? Not quite everyone. Who's behind? Mine. Hey, guys. Why do the toys cross the road? Not now, Hamm. Oh, I love riddles. Why? To get to the chicken on the other side! The chicken! Oh, well. We tried. We'll have to cross. What the. You're not turning me into a mashed potato. I may not be a smart dog, but I know what roadkill is. There must be a safe way. Okay. Here's our chance. Ready. Set. Go. Drop! Go! Drop! I said drop! Go! Drop. Go. That went well. Good job, troops. We're that much closer to Woody. Oh, thank goodness you're here. Is the specimen ready for cleaning? So, how long is this gonna take? You can't rush art. Oh, no. It's closed. We're not preschool toys, Slinky. We can read. Hey, Joe, you're late. We've got a ton of toys to unload. All right. All right. I'm comin'. I'm comin'. All right. Let's go. But the sign says it's closed. No, no, no, no. All together. Now! Whoa, Nelly! How are we going to find Woody in this place? Look for Al. We find Al, we find Woody. Now move out! Woody? Woody. There you go. He's for display only. You handle him too much, he's not gonna last. It's amazing. You're a genius. He's just like new. Wow. I could use one of those. You know, they make it so you can't defeat Zurg unless you buy this book. It's extortion. That's what it is. Hey, I always thought the golden sector was the only. I thought we could search in style. Nice going there, Hamm. So how about letting a toy with fingers drive? Am I really that fat? What are you doing? You're in direct violation of Code 6404.5, stating all Space Rangers are to be in hypersleep until awakened by authorised personnel. Oh, no. You're breakin' ranks, Ranger. Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. I've got an AWOL Space Ranger. Tell me I wasn't this deluded. No back talk! I have a laser, and I will use it. Mean the laser that's a light bulb? Has your mind been melded? You could've killed me, Space Ranger. Or should I say traitor? I don't have time for this. Halt! I order you to halt! Listen to me. Listen. Wait. We've been down this aisle already. We've never been down this aisle. It's pink. Face it. We're lost. Back it up. Back it up. What a great party?! How low can you go? How low can you go? Excuse me, ladies. Does anyone know where we might find the Al ofAl's Toy Barn? I can help. I'm Tour Guide Barbie. Please keep your hands, arms and accessories inside the car, and no flash photography. Thank you. I'm a married spud. I'm a married spud. Then make room for the single fellas. To our right is the Hot Wheels aisle. Developed in 1967, the original series had 16 cars, including the Corvette. I beg your pardon, ma'am, but where's Al's office? Please hold all questions until the end of the tour. Thank you. It says how you defeat Zurg! Look! Excuse me, sir. Get this outta here, geekosaur. Look out! Stop, stop, stop! Turn into the spin, Barbie! My source of power! No! Come back! Hey! Wait up! Hey! Come on! Slow down! Dinosaur overboard! Slow down! Remain seated, please. Listen to me. Listen to me. You're not really a Space Ranger. You're a toy. We're all toys. Do you hear me? Well, that should hold you till the court martial. Let me go! You don't realise what you're doing! And this is the Buzz Lightyear aisle. In 1995, shortsighted retailers did not order enough dolls to meet demand. Hey, Buzz! Halt! Who goes there? Quit clownin' around and get in the car! Buzz, Buzz, I know how to defeat Zurg! You do? Come on. I'll tell you on the way. No, no, guys! You've got the wrong Buzz! You've got the wrong Buzz! Say, where'd you get the cool belt, Buzz? Well, slotted pig, they're standard issue. No! It's like printing my own money. Yeah? What? Mr. Konishi. Yes, I have the pictures right here. In fact, I'm in the car right now on my way to the office to fax them to you. I'm going through a tunnel! I'm breakin' up! Oh, wow! Will you look at me? It's like I'm fresh out of the box! Look at this stitching! Andy's gonna have a hard time rippin' this! Hello! Hi! Hello! Great. Now you can go. Well, what a good idea. Woody, don't be mad at Jessie. She's been through more than you know. Why not make amends before you leave, huh? It's the least you can do. All right. But I don't know what good it'll do. Hey. Whatcha doin' way up here? Thought I'd get one last look at the sun before I get packed away again. Look, Jessie. I know you hate me for leaving, but I have to go back. I'm still Andy's toy. Well, if you knew him, you'd understand. Andy's a real. Let me guess. Andy's a real special kid. And to him, you're his buddy, his best friend. And when Andy plays with you, it's like even though you're not moving, you feel like you're alive, because that's how he sees you. How did you know that? Because Emily was just the same. She was my whole world. When somebody loved me Everything was beautiful Every hour we spent together Lives within my heart And when she was sad I was there to dry her tears And when she was happy, so was I When she loved me Through the Summer and the Fall We had each other That was all Just she and I together Like it was meant to be And when she was lonely I was there to comfort her And I knew that She loved me So the years went by I stayed the same But she began to drift away I was left alone Still I waited for the day When she'd say I will always love you Lonely and forgotten I never thought she'd look my way She smiled at me and held me Just like she used to do Like she loved me When she loved me When somebody loved me Everything was beautiful Every hour we spent together Lives within my heart When she loved me You never forget kids like Emily or Andy. But they forget you. Jessie, I didn't know. Just go. How long will it last, Woody? Do you really think Andy is gonna take you to college or on his honeymoon? Andy's growing up, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's your choice, Woody. You can go back, or you can stay with us and last forever. You'll be adored by children for generations. Who am I to break up the Roundup gang? Hey, Woody, are you in here? Nah. This one's empty too. Woody! Woody! Woody! Pardon me, gentlemen, but have either of you seen a cowboy doll with a bad arm? Why, no, I haven't. Hey! He was talkin' to me! No! He was talkin' to me! Why, you. You see, all along, we thought the way into Zurg's fortress was through the main gate, but in fact the secret entrance is to the left, hidden in the shadows. To the left in the shadows. Got it. Someone's coming. Everyone, take cover. It was a big pileup, but I don't want to bore you with the details. Yes. Now, let me confirm your fax number. 011. 011. Wait. That's a lot of numbers. No. I got it. It's him. The chicken man. Funny, he doesn't look like poultry. That's the kidnapper, all right. A kidnapper! An agent of Zurg if I ever saw one. And the de I promise the collection will be the crown jewel of your museum. It's Woody! Now that I have your attention, imagine we added another zero to the price, huh? I'll pay anything you want. Yes! Yes! You got a deal! I'll be on the next flight to Japan! Quick. Into the poultry man's cargo unit. He'll lead us to Zurg. Move, move, move! Don't touch my moustache! Rich, rich, rich, rich! Destroy Buzz Lightyear. Destroy Buzz Lightyear. Destroy Buzz Lightyear. He didn't take the bag! No time to lose! He's ascending in the vertical transporter. All right, everyone. Hang on. We're gonna blast through the roof. Buzz? To infinity and beyond! What are you? Insane? We're wasting time. Stand still, Godzilla. I don't understand. Somehow my fuel cells have gone dry. Blast. He's on level 23. How are we gonna get up there? Maybe if we find some balloons, we could float to the top. Are you kidding? I say we stack ourselves up, push the intercom and pretend we're delivering a pizza. How about a ham sandwich with fries and a hot dog? What about me? You can be the toy that comes with the meal. Troops! Over here. Just like you said, lizard man. In the shadows to the left. Okay. Let's move! Mission log. Have infiltrated enemy territory without detection and are making our way through the bowels of Zurg's fortress. You know, I think that Buzz aisle went to his head. Oh, no. Which way do we go? This way! What makes you so sure? I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure. We've been detected. The walls! They're closing in! Quick! Help me prop up vegetable man, or we're done for. Hey! Put me down, you moron! Guys, look! It's not the walls! It's the elevator! Come on. We've got no time to lose. Everyone, grab hold! What? Buzz, why not just take the elevator? They'll be expecting that. Hey, Buzz! Stop! Slow down! To overnight six packages to Japan is how much? That's in yen, right? Dollars? You are deliberately taking advantage of people in a hurry, you know that? All right. I'll do it! All right. Fine. I'll have the stuff in the lobby, and you'd better be here in 15 minutes, because I have a plane to catch, do you hear me? We're finally going. Can you believe it? That's customfitted foam insulation you'll be riding in, Bullseye. First class all the way! You know what? I'm actually excited about this. I mean it. I really am! And why shouldn't you be? Yeehaw! Swing your partner dosido Look at you, dancing cowboy! Look! I'm doin' the box step! Hey, heads up down there! Whoa! Pork bellies are fallin'. Hey, how much farther, Buzz? Halfway there. My arms can't hold on much longer! Too heavy. What was I thinking? My antigravity servos! Hang tight, everyone. I'm going to let go of the wall. What? He wouldn't. One. He would. Two. Three! To infinity and beyond! Approaching destination. Reengaging gravity. Area secure. It's okay, troops. The antigravity sickness will wear off momentarily. Now let's move! Remind me to glue his helmet shut when we get back. How 'bout givin' me a little intro there, Jessie? Introducing the highridin' est cowboy around. You forgot rootin' tootin' est! The highridin' est, rootin' tootin' est cowboy hero of all time, Sheriff Woody! Say, little missy, you notice any trouble around these parts? Nary a bit, not with Sheriff Woody around. Wait, wait, wait! I got it! This is great! Okay! The bandits got the critters tied up in the burning barn. Now the best part! Help us! The barn's on fire! I've got ya, critters. No need to worry. Woody saves the day again! Yeehaw! Now, where's my trusty steed Bullseye? I have to ride off into the sunset. Ride like the wind, Bullseye! Watch it. Wait. I'm ticklish, okay? Oh, you are? No, no, no. Cut it out. Stop it. Stop it. No, please. No, no. Stop! Stop! Mission log. Have reached Zurg's command deck, but no sign of him or his wooden captive. Please, no! That's Woody! This way! Please, please, no! Buzz, can you see? What's going on? Take that! To the left. No, your left. Take it up higher. What's happening? Oh, it's horrible. They. They're torturing him. What are we gonna do, Buzz? Use your head! But I don't wanna use my head! What's going on here? Buzz, guys! Hey, how did you find me? Watch yourself! We're here to spring ya, Woody! You heard of kung fu? Well, get ready for pork chop. Prepare to meet Mr. Angry Eyes! Hold it, now! Hey, you don't understand! These are my friends! Yeah, we're his friends! No, Rex, I mean they're my friends! Hey, stop it! Leave him alone, springy dog! Hey! Grab Woody, and let's go! Fellas, hold it! Buzz, put me down! Quick! To the vent! They're stealing him. No! Hold it right there! Buzz? You again? Thank goodness you're all right. Buzz, what is going on? Hold on. I am Buzz Lightyear, and I'm in charge of this detachment. No, I'm Buzz Lightyear. I'm Buzz Lightyear! I'm Buzz Lightyear! So, who's the real Buzz? I am! Don't let this impostor fool you! He's been trained by Zurg himself to mimic my every move. Buzz! I had a feelin' it was you. My front end just had to catch up with my back end. Will somebody please explain what's going on? It's all right, Space Ranger. It's a code 546. You mean it's a. Yes. And he's a. Oh, yeah. Your Majesty. Woody, you're in danger here. We need to leave now. Al's selling you to a toy museum in Japan! I know. It's okay, Buzz. I actually wanna go. What? Are you crazy? Look, the thing is, I'm a rare Sheriff Woody doll, and these guys are my Roundup gang. What are you talking about? Woody's Roundup! Oh, it's this great old TV show, and I was the star. See? Now look. Look! Look at me! See? That's me! This is weirdin' me out. Buzz, it was a national phenomenon. There was all this merchandise that got packed up. You should have seen it. There was a record player and a yoyo. Buzz, I was a yoyo! Was? Stop this nonsense and let's go. Nah, Buzz. I can't go. I can't abandon these guys. They need me to get into this museum. Without me, they'll go back into storage. Maybe forever! Woody, you're not a collector's item. You're a child's plaything. You are a toy! For how much longer? One more rip, and Andy's done with me. And what do I do then, Buzz? You tell me. Somewhere in that pad of stuffing is a toy who taught me that life's only worth living if you're bein' loved by a kid. And I travelled all this way to rescue that toy because I believed him. Well, you wasted your time. Let's go, everyone. What about Woody? He's not coming with us. But. But Andy's coming home tonight. Then we'd better make sure we're there waiting for him. I don't have a choice, Buzz. This is my only chance. To do what, Woody? Watch kids from behind glass and never be loved again? Some life. Is everybody okay? Sheriff Woody! I knew you'd make it! Now, remember, deputies, the real treasures are your friends and family. Before I go, kids, I want to share somethin' special with you, for the times I'm not around. Good going, Woody! I thought they'd never leave. You've got a friend in me Woody? You've got troubles Well, I've got 'em too There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you We stick together and see it through 'Cause you've got a friend in me Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am Bigger and stronger too Maybe But none of them will ever love you The way I do It's me and you, boy And as the years go by Our friendship will never die You're gonna see it's our destiny What am I doing? Buzz! Wait! Wait! Woody, where are you going? You're right, Prospector. I can't stop Andy from growing up. But I wouldn't miss it for the world. No! Buzz! Yes? Yes? I'm coming with you! Wait, wait, wait. I'll be back in just a second. Way to go, cowboy! Hey, you guys. Come with me. What? Andy will play with all of us. I know it! Woody, I don't know. I. Wouldn't you give anything just to have one more day with Emily? Come on, Jessie. This is what it's all about, to make a child happy. And you know it. Bullseye, are you with me? Okay, good boy. Prospector, how 'bout you? Prospector? You're outta your box! I tried reasoning with you, Woody, but you keep forcing me to take extreme measures. Wait a minute. You turned on the TV last night, not Jessie. Look, we have an eternity to spend together in the museum. Let's not start off by pointing fingers, shall we? You really are Stinky Pete, aren't you? Prospector, this isn't fair. Fair? I'll tell you what's not fair. Spending a lifetime on a dimestore shelf watching every other toy be sold. Well, finally my waiting has paid off, and no handmedown cowboy doll is gonna mess it up for me now! Buzz. Help, Buzz! Guys! It's too late, Woody. That silly Buzz Lightweight can't help you. His name is Buzz Lightyear. Whatever. I've always hated those upstart space toys. It's stuck! What do we do? Should I use my head? It's Al! Look at the time. I'm gonna be late! Figures. I can't miss this flight! I've gotta pack. All right. Let's see. Wallet, keys, tickets, passport, beefjerky, very expensive over there. Shower! Oh, I can skip the shower.

I AM your father. No! Come on! Come on! Come on! Buzz, you could have defeated Zurg all along! You just need to believe in yourself! Prepare to die! I can't look! Whoa! I did it. I finally defeated Zurg! Father. Finally! How are we gonna get him now? Pizza, anyone? Go, go, go! I got it! Buzz, are you coming? No, I have a lot of catching up to do with my dad. Good throw, son. That's my boy. Go long, Buzzy! Oh, you're a great dad. Farewell. Does anyone know how to drive? Slink, take the pedals. Rex, you navigate. Hamm and Potato, operate the levers and knobs. Whoa.

You got that, sport? You be careful! I understand, sir. Do you have a fragile sticker or something? I had a box of cookies once that came back as crumbs! The Mystic Portal! Once we go through, we just need to find that case. There's the case! No, there's the case! You take that one! We'll take this one! Whoa! Buzz! Buzz, my back end's goin' to Baton Rouge! Slinky! Here we come, Woody! Woody, here we come! Woody! Nice flash, though. Okay, Woody, let's go! Take that, space toy. Hey! No one does that to my friend! Your choice, Woody. You can go to Japan together or in pieces. If he fixed ya once, he can fix ya again. Now get in the box! Never! Fine! No! Gotcha! Idiots! Children destroy toys! You'll all be ruined, forgotten! Spending eternity rotting in some landfill! Well, Stinky Pete, I think it's time you learned the true meaning of playtime. Right over there, guys! No. No! No!

You can go back, or you can stay with us and last forever. Good heavens. Was that me? Oh, my. I am so sorry. I guess that's why they call me Stinky Pete. Okay, let's cut. We are so glad you came.

Hello? Hello? Anyone there? Molly, stay out of my room! l wasn't in your room. Then who was messing with my stuff? lt wasn't me. Well, that went well. He held me! He actually held me! This is just sad. Who we kiddin'? The kid's 1 7 years old. We ain't ever gettin' played with. Guys, hey, hold up. We need a staff meeting. Everyone! A staff meeting! Not again! Come on. Slink, gather everyone up. We are gathered, Woody. Okay. First off, we all knew Operation Playtime was a long shot. More like a misfire. But we've always said this job isn't about getting played with. lt's about. Being there for Andy. We know. But we can try again! Right? l'm callin' it, guys. We're closing up shop. What? Andy's going to college any day now. That was our last shot. We're going into attic mode, folks. Keep your accessories with you at all times. Spare parts, batteries, anything you need for an orderly transition. Orderly? Don't you get it? We're done! Finished! Over the hill! Hey, hey, hey, now. Come on, guys. We all knew this day was coming. Yeah, but now it's here. Look, every toy goes through this. No one wants to see. Hey, Sarge! What are you doing? War's over, folks. Me and the boys are moving on. Moving on? You're going AWOL? We done our duty. Andy's grown up. And let's face it, when the trash bags come out, we army guys are the first to go. Trash bags? Who said anything about trash bags? lt has been an honor serving with you. Good luck, folks. You're gonna need it. No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait! We're getting thrown away? No. No one's getting thrown away. How do you know? We're being abandoned! We'll be fine, Jessie. So why did Sarge leave? Should we leave? l thought we were goin' to the attic. l hate all this uncertainty! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet! No one's getting thrown out, okay? We're all still here. l mean, yeah, we've lost friends along the way. Wheezy and Etch and. Bo Peep? Yeah. Even Bo. All good toys who've gone on to new owners. But through every yard sale, every spring cleaning, Andy held on to us! He must care about us, or we wouldn't be here. You wait. Andy's gonna tuck us in the attic. lt'll be safe and warm. And we'll all be together. Exactly! There's games up there, and books, and. The racecar track! The racecar track. Thank you! And the old TV. There you go, the old TV. And those guys from the Christmas decorations box. They're fun, right? Yeah. And someday, if we're lucky, Andy may have kids of his own. And he'll play with us then, right? We'll always be there for him. Come on, guys. Let's get our parts together, get ready, and go out on a high note. l'd better find my other eye. Where'd you leave it this time? Someplace dark. And dusty. Come on. Let's see how much we're going for on eBay. Don't worry. Andy's gonna take care of us. l guarantee it! You guarantee it, huh? l don't know, Buzz. What else could l say? Well, whatever happens, at least we'll all be together. For infinity and beyond. Can l have your stereo? No. Why not? 'Cause l'm taking it with me. Can l have your computer? No. Your video games? Forget it, Molly. Okay. Andy, let's get to work here. Anything you're not taking to college either goes in the attic, or it's trash. Mom, l'm not leaving till Friday. Come on. lt's garbage day. Mom. Look, it's simple. Skateboard, college. Little League trophy, probably attic. Apple core, trash. You can do the rest. Why do you still have these toys? Molly, out of my room! Three more days and it's mine! Molly, you're not off the hook either. You have more toys than you know what to do with. Some of them could make other kids really happy. What kids? The children at the daycare. They're always asking for donations. What's daycare? Mom. No buts. You choose the toys you want to donate, l'll drop them off at Sunnyside. Poor Barbie. l get the Corvette. Andy, come on. You need to start making decisions. Like what? Like what are you gonna do with these toys? Should we donate them to Sunnyside? No. Maybe sell them online? Mom, no one's gonna want those old toys. They're junk. Fine. You have till Friday. Anything that's not packed for college or in the attic is getting thrown out. Whatever you say, Mom. What's happening? We're getting thrown out, you idiot. That's what's happening. You need a hand? l got it. Here. So, you gonna miss me when l'm gone? lf l say no, do l still get your room? Nope. Then, yes, l'll miss you. l can't breathe! This can't be happening! Quiet! What's that sound? Andy! That's not trash. That's not trash! Think, think, Woody. Think, think, think. Buster! Come here, boy! Come here! Okay, boy. To the curb! No, Buster! No! Get up. Buster! We're on the curb! l knew it would come to this! Pull, everyone! Pull! lt won't rip! Forget it! lt's tripleply, highdensity polyethylene! There's gotta be a way out! Andy doesn't want us. What's the point? Point. Point. Point! Push! Push! l can hear the garbage truck! lt's getting closer. Buzz! Jessie! Andy threw us out. Like we were garbage. Junk. He called us junk. How could he? This doesn't make any sense. l should have seen this coming. lt's Emily all over again. Sarge was right. Yeah, and Woody was wrong. Wait a minute. Wait, hold on. This is no time to be hysterical. lt's the perfect time to be hysterical. Should we be hysterical? No! Yes! Maybe! But not right now! Fellas, l know what to do. What the heck? We should've done this years ago. Jessie, wait. What about Woody? He's fine, Buzz. Andy's taking him to college. Now we need to go! You're right. Come on. Buzz? Woody! What's going on? Don't you know this box is being donated? lt's under control, Woody. We have a plan. We're going to daycare! Daycare? What, have you all lost your marbles? Well, didn't you see? Andy threw us away. No, no, no, no. He was putting you in the attic. Attic? So how did we end up on the curb? That was a mistake. Andy's mom thought you were trash. Yeah. After he put us in a trash bag. And called us junk! Yeah, l know. lt looks bad. But, guys, you gotta believe me. Sure thing, college boy! Andy's moving on, Woody. lt's time we did the same. Andy's moving on, Woody. lt's time we did the same. Okay. Out of the box. Everyone, right now! Come on, Buzz. Give me a hand. We gotta get this thing outta here. Woody, wait. We need to figure out what's best for everyone. Great. Great! lt's gonna take us forever to get back here. lt's all right, Barbie. You'll be okay. Well, Molly and l have been growing apart for years. lt's just. l can't believe she would throw me away! Welcome to the club, toots. Okay, everyone, listen up. We can get back to Andy's, but we gotta move fast. We'll hide under the seats till we get back home. Get it through your vinyl noggin, Woody. Andy doesn't want us anymore. He was putting you in the attic! He left us on the curb! All right, calm down! Both of you! Okay, fine. Fine. Just wait till you see what daycare's like. Why? What's it like? Daycare is a sad, lonely place for washedup old toys who have no owners. Quite the charmer, aren't ya? You'll see. As soon as we get to daycare, you'll be begging to go home. Can anyone see anything? There's a playground! Wow! We hit the jackpot, Bullseye! So much for sad and lonely, huh? Okay. Calm down, guys. Let's just keep this in perspective. Perspective? This place is perfect. Woody, it's nice! See? The door has a rainbow on it. Hey there! Wow! Haven't seen you in ages. l just wanted to drop these old toys off. ls this Bonnie? Look how big you are. ls this Bonnie? Look how big you are. Say hi, sweetie. Hi. Hey, how are your kids? Molly and Andy? Not kids anymore. Andy's going to college on Friday. What? Can you believe it? You sure they won't miss these?

But what happens when the kids grow up? Well, now, l'll tell ya. When the kids get old, new ones come in. When they get old, new ones replace them. You'll never be outgrown or neglected, never abandoned or forgotten. No owners means no heartbreak. lt's a miracle. And you wanted us to stay at Andy's. Because we're Andy's toys! So you got donated by this Andy, huh? Well, it's his loss, Sheriff. He can't hurt you no more. Whoa, whoa, no, no, no. Now, let's get you all settled in. Ken? Where is that boy? Ken? New toys!

Now, l'm going home. Anyone who wants to join me is welcome. Come on, Buzz. Buzz? Our mission with Andy is complete, Woody. What? And what's important now is we stay together. We wouldn't even be together if it weren't for Andy! Look under your boot, Buzz. You, too, Jessie. Whose name is written there? Maybe Andy doesn't care about us anymore. Of course he does. He cares about all of you! He was putting you in the attic. l saw. You can't just turn your back on him now! Woody, wake up! lt's over! Andy is all grown up! Okay, fine.

Great. lt's gonna be okay, Bullseye. Woody's going to college with Andy. lt's what he's always wanted. He's crazy. College is no place for a toy. Toys are for playtime. Speaking of playtime, they're lining up out there! How many? There must be dozens. l can hardly wait! Places, everyone! At last! l'm gonna get played with! Rex? Come to papa. There's a snake in my boot. l'd like to join your posse, boys, but first l'm gonna sing a little song. A sheriff! Move over, Mr. Pricklepants. We have a guest.

We're either in a cafe in Paris or a coffee shop in New Jersey. l'm pretty sure l just came back from the doctor with lifechanging news. We do a lot of improv here. Just stay loose, have fun, you'll be fine. No, no, no, no. l. Who wants lunch? lt has a secret ingredient. Jelly beans. Somebody's poisoned the water hole. Poison? Who would do such a mean thing? The scary witch! Look out! She's using her witchy powers! l know where to hide. She'll never find us in here. What's wrong? She found us! We need a spaceship to get away from the witch! You're doing great! Are you classicallytrained? Look, l just need to know how to get out of here! There is no way out. Just kidding. Door's right over there. Well, cowboy, you just jumped right in, didn't ya? l'm Dolly. Woody. Woody? Really? You're gonna stick with that? 'Cause now's your chance to change it, new room and all.

Honey, the mustache? l don't recall playtime being quite that strenuous. Andy never played with us like that. We're just gonna have to make the best of it. But these toddlers, they don't know how to play with us. They're too young! Yeah, they're sticky. Well, we should be in the Butterfly Room. With the big kids! That's right. Yeah, you said it. We'll get this straightened out. l'll go talk to Lotso about moving us to the other room. Blast. Try that one. lt's locked! Same here. Try the windows. Negatory. lt's a FensterSchneckler 380.

Okay, minimum bet, five Monopoly. Coyote's wild. Here, here. Two greens here. Changing two double A's. Hey, what do you guys think of the new recruits? Any keepers? Oh, please! Landfill! Cowgirl? Dinosaur? Toddler fodder. But that space guy, he could be useful. But that space guy, he could be useful. He ain't the sharpest knife in the place where they keep the knives. Neither are you, Chunk. You got a little keeper yourself, didn't you, Ken? Hey, lay off, Twitch. Barbie's different. Aw, Mr. Softy over here. What do you expect from a girl's toy? l'm not a girl's toy! l'm not! Why do you guys keep saying that? All them toys are disposable. We'll be lucky if they last us a week. Well, well. Looky who we have here. Let me go! Take him to the libary. No! 1 225 Sycamore. Woody, what are you doing? l gotta get outta here. You're leaving? But didn't you have fun today? Well, of course l did, more than l've had in years, but, you see, l belong to someone else. Who's Yidnuh? l believe it's pronounced Yidnay. Guys, it says Andy. He's my Bonnie. And he's leaving soon. l gotta get home. Where's home? Elm Street. 234 Elm. You guys have a map? We're on it, cowboy. Trixie? l'll fire up the computer. Unhand me, you cowards! l demand to talk to Lotso! Zip it, Buck Rogers. You don't talk to Lotso till we say you can. Ken? What's goin' on here? Why is this toy tied up? He got out, Lotso. Got out? No, no, no, no, no. This isn't how we treat our guests. FAOh, my Schwarz. There you go. l'm so sorry. Lotso, there's been a mistake. A mistake? The children in the Caterpillar Room are not ageappropriate for me and my friends. We respectfully request a transfer to the Butterfly Room. Well, request granted! But, Lotso. Hush now, Kenneth. This toy's shown initiative, leadership. Why, l'd say we've found ourselves a keeper. Hear that, everyone? We got a keeper! We're calling you up to the big leagues, son. From now on, you'll have anything you want. Excellent. l'll go get my friends. Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, boss. Those Caterpillar kids need someone to play with. But my friends don't belong there. None of us do, l agree. Which is why, for the good of our community, we ask the newer toys, the stronger ones, to take on the hardships the rest of us can't bear anymore. Well, l guess that makes sense. But l can't accept. We're a family. We stay together. Family man, huh? l understand. Put him back in the timeout chair. What are ya. Unhand me! Bring in the Bookworm. Here it is. lt was filed under Lightyear. Let's see here. Accessories. Maintenance. Here we go. Remove screws to access battery compartment. What are you doing? Stop! Let go of me! To return your Buzz Lightyear action figure to its original factory settings. No! slide the switch from Play to Demo. Stop! No! No! No! What was that? Sounds like it came from the hall. l'll see what it was. What do you see? Anything? No, just a dark hallway and. Wait. Wait! l see Andy! What? That's impossible. No, no, l really see him. ln his room. My other eye! The one l left behind. This is so weird. He's packing up. Here comes Buster. Out of the way! Get away! Okay, Andy's out in the hall. He's looking in the attic. Wait, there's Mom. Why is he so upset? Oh, no! Oh, this is terrible! He's looking for us. Andy's looking for us! He's looking for us? So Andy does want us. l knew it! l just knew it! l think he did mean to put us in the attic. Well, then, Woody was telling the truth. Holy cow! And you didn't believe him. Hey, you didn't believe him first! Guys, we gotta. We gotta go home! Lotso! Hey, there. How y'all doin' this fine evenin'? Thank goodness! Have you seen Buzz? There's been a mistake. We have to go. Go? Why, you just got here. ln the nick of time, too. We were runnin' low on volunteers for the little ones. They just love new toys, now, don't they? Love? We've been chewed, kicked, drooled on. Just look at my pocketbook! Well, here's the thing, sweet potato. You ain't leavin' Sunnyside. Sweet potato! Who do you think you're talking to? l have over 30 accessories, and l deserve more respect. That's better. Hey, no one takes my wife's mouth, except me. Give it back, you furry air freshener! Come on, guys. We're goin' home. Whoa there, missy. You're not goin' anywhere. Oh, yeah? And who's gonna stop us? Buzz! You're back! Buzz? Hey! Look out! What are you, nuts? Buzz! Prisoners disabled, Commander Lotso! Buzz, what are you doing? Silence, minions of Zurg! You're in the custody of the Galactic Alliance! Zurg? Galactic Alliance? Oh, boy. Good work, Lightyear. Now, lock 'em up! Yes, sir! Where do you think you're going? Buzz! We're your friends! Spare me your lies, temptress. Your emperor's defeated, and l'm immune to your bewitching good looks. Hey, Mongo! Keep your paws off my wife! Hey! Let go of me, you drooling doofus! Not him. l think this potato needs to learn himself some manners. Take him to the box. Hey! Put me down, you moron! Where are you taking me? Bad baby! Bad baby! Ken? What's going on? Barbie! l told you to wait in the Dream House. What are you doing to my friends? Get in there! Barbie, wait! Don't touch me. We're through! Barbie! l did. And give me my scarf back! Lightyear! Explain our overnight accommodations. Sir, yes, sir! Prisoners sleep in their cells. Any prisoner caught outside their cell spends the night in the box. Roll call at dusk and dawn. Any prisoner misses roll call, spends the night in the box. Prisoners do not speak unless spoken to. Any prisoner talks back, spends the night. ln the box! We get it. At ease, soldier. They're neutralized. But remember, they'll say anything to make you doubt yourself. Don't worry, Commander. Any doubt l had got pounded out of me at the academy. Listen up, folks. We got a way of doin' things here at Sunnyside. lf you start at the bottom, pay your dues, life here can be a dream come true! But if you break our rules, step outta line, try to check out early, well, you're just hurtin' yourselves. Woody! What did you do to him? You all get a good night's rest. You got a full day of playtime tomorrow. 1 225 Syca. Who's Velocistar237? Who's Velocistar237? That's just a dinosaur toy down the street. That's nothing. Let me just take care of that. Just a dinosaur. All right. Sycamore. Okay, enter! Please don't be far. Please, please! Right around the corner? lt's right around the corner! l'm going to college! Look at me! l'm big toy on campus! Hello! Hey, l'll see you at the sock hop. Okay, Potsie. Hey, listen. lf any of you guys ever get to Sunnyside Daycare, you tell 'em Woody made it home. You came from Sunnyside? But how'd you escape? Well, it wasn't easy. What do you mean escape? Sunnyside is a place of ruin and despair. Ruled by an evil bear who smells of strawberries. Lotso? The guy may seem plush and huggable on the outside, but inside, he's a monster. But. How do you know that? Chuckles. He'll tell you. Yeah, l knew Lotso. He was a good toy. A friend. Me and him, we had the same kid, Daisy. l was there when Lotso got unwrapped. Daisy loved us all. But Lotso, Lotso was special. They did everything together. You've never seen a kid and a toy more in love. One day, we took a drive. Hit a rest stop. Had a little playtime. After lunch, Daisy fell asleep. She never came back. Lotso wouldn't give up. lt took forever, but we finally made it back to Daisy's. But by then, it was too late. Something changed that day inside Lotso. Something snapped. She replaced us. Come on! No, she only replaced you! She replaced all of us. Didn't she? She don't love you no more! Now come on! We were lost. Cast off. Unloved. Unwanted. Then we found Sunnyside. But Lotso wasn't my friend anymore. He wasn't anyone's friend. He took over Sunnyside and rigged the whole system. So how'd you get out? l got broke. Bonnie found me, took me home. Other toys, they weren't so lucky. lt ain't right what Lotso done. New toys, they don't stand a chance. But my friends are in there. You can't go back. Returning now would be suicide! But what about your Andy? lsn't he leaving for college? Quiet, musical hog! Knock it off! Oh, Bullseye. l miss Woody, too. But he ain't ever comin' back. Rise and shine, campers! Commander Lotso, sir! All quiet, nothing to report. Excellent, Lightyear. Come on. We need ya back at Star Command. Wait! What've you done with my husband? Big Baby. Sweetheart! lt was cold and dark. Nothing but sand and a couple of Lincoln Logs. l don't think those were Lincoln Logs. You all get ready. You got a playdate with destiny! Hello? You shouldn't have come back, cowboy. They've cracked down hard since you left. More guards, more patrols. You and your friends ain't ever getting out of here now. l made it out once. You got lucky once. Want my advice? Keep your heads down. You'll survive. Yeah, for how long? l've been here years. They'll never break me. There's only one way toys leave this place. There's only one way toys leave this place. Poor fella. Trash truck comes at dawn. Then it's off to the dump. Look, l appreciate your concern, oldtimer. But we have a kid waiting for us. Now, we're leaving. lf you'd help us, one toy to another, l'd sure be grateful. Well, if you're gonna get out, first thing you gotta get through's the doors. Locked, every night. lnside and out. Keys are left on a hook in the office. Got it. What else? Lotso has trucks patrolling all night long. Hallway, lobby, playground. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What about the wall? Eightfeet high. Cinder block. No way through it. You go over or under. That's it? Doesn't seem so bad. lt's not. Your real problem's the monkey. The monkey's the eye in the sky. He sees everything. Classrooms. Hallways. Even the playground. You can unlock doors, sneak past guards, climb the wall, but if you don't take out that monkey, you ain't going nowhere. You wanna get out of here? Get rid of that monkey! Recess! Come on, kids! Hey, guys. Woody? Woody! Woody! Hey, hey, hey, buddy! Thank goodness! You're alive! 'Course l'm alive! Hey, my hat! Wait, where's Buzz? Lotso did something to him! He thinks he's a real Space Ranger again. Oh, no. Oh, yes. Return of the astronut. Woody, we were wrong to leave Andy. l was wrong. Jessie's right, Woody. She was wrong. No, no, it's my fault for leaving you guys. From now on, we stick together. But Andy's leavin' for college. College? Hogtie the mailman! We gotta get you home before Andy leaves tomorrow! Tomorrow? But that means. lt means we're busting out of here, tonight. What? lmpossible! But there's no way out of here! No, there is one way out. One way. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Springy dog. Present. Green guys. Cowgirl. Here. Horse. Piggy bank. Yo. Tyrannosaurus. Here. Barbie. Here. Potato Head. Potato Head? Hey! Hey! Tuberous rootman! Wake up! lmpossible! Hey! Little late for a stroll, eh, Potato Head? That's Mr. Potato Head to you, smoothie. Well, well, well. You're turning out to be quite the troublemaker, aren't you? What did you think you were gonna do? Waltz right out of here? Yeah, and l would've got away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling toys! You ascotwearing pinknoser! You're not a toy! You're an accessory! You're a purse with legs. Take him back to the box. No! No, not the box! l'm sorry. l didn't mean it! l like ascots. Really. No, no, no! Okay, check. Good work, Lightyear. All right, resume your spaceguythingy. Yes, sir, wellgroomed man! Ken! Ken? What do you want? l can't take it here, Ken. l wanna go to the Butterfly Room. With you!

Break it up! Hey! Hey! Take that, walnutbrain. No wonder you're extinct. Hey, you can't hit each other. That's my job! Help! Prison riot! Get the tortilla. Ready? Ready. Barbie? No more games, Ken! What did Lotso do to Buzz? And how do we switch him back? You can't make me talk. You can't! But l'd like to see you try. Let's see. Hawaiian surf trunks. Barbie! Those were vintage! lt's okay. All right, go ahead, rip 'em, l don't care. They're a dime a dozen. Glitter tux. Who cares? Who cares? Sequins are tacky. Who cares? A Nehru jacket. Barbie! Not the Nehru. This is from what, 1 967? The groovy formal collection, yes! What a shame. Oh, no, no, no! No! There's an instruction manual! Lotso switched Buzz to Demo mode! Where's that manual? l don't know why this couldn't wait until morning, Ken, but here you go. What's takin' so doggone long? So how do we fix Buzz? What are you looking at, feathers? Hey! Yeah, fly away, you coward. Well, that's just great. Help! Prison riot! Mayday! Mayday! Give it up. No one can hear you. What? l said, No one can hear you. What? He said, No one can. Shush! Will you be quiet? Woody! You're back! Stop him! Don't let him get out! Star Command! l've been taken hostage by my own prisoners. Quick! Open his back. There's a switch! Unhand me, Zurg scum! The Galactic Courts will show you no mercy. lt's not working. Why is it not working? Where's the manual? Here we go! There should be a little hole under the switch. Little hole, got it! To reset your Buzz Lightyear, insert paperclip. Rex, use your finger! What? Okay, now what? All right, let's see. Caution. Do not hold button for more than five seconds. lt's not my fault! Star Log. l've awakened from hypersleep on a strange planet. Now what did you do? l just did what you told me! l'm surrounded by alien creatures of unknown intent. Who goes there? Friend? Or foe? Amigos! We're all amigos. l must have crashlanded and had my memory erased. Anyone seen my spaceship? We gotta switch him back. Well, how do we do that? l don't know. That part's in Spanish. We don't have time for this. Come on, El Buzzo. My spaceship? You know where it is? Excellent! Good luck, cowboy. Here they come. Come on, Buzz! What took you so long? Things got complicated. Where's Potato Head? We haven't seen him. Buzz. My desert flower! l have never seen true beauty until this night! Did you fix Buzz? Sort of. Behind you. Someone's coming. You would not believe what l've been through tonight. Darling! Are you okay? l feel fresh. Healthy. lt's terrible. You've lost weight. And so tall. You're a sight for detachable eyes. All clear.

Look who's back. l'm sorry, cowboy. They broke me. What are y'all doing? Running back to your kid? He don't want you no more. That's a lie. ls it? Tell me this, Sheriff. lf your kid loves you so much, why is he leaving? You think you're special, cowboy? You're a piece of plastic. You were made to be thrown away. Speak of the devil. Now, we need toys in our Caterpillar Room and you need to avoid that truck. Why don't you come on back, join our family again? This isn't a family! lt's a prison! You're a liar and a bully! And l'd rather rot in this dumpster than join any family of yours! Jessie's right! Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force. lf that's what you want. Barbie! Wait! Don't do this, Lotso. She's a Barbie doll, Ken. There's a hundred million just like her. Not to me, there's not. Fine. Then why don't you join her! Oh, Ken! Everyone, listen! Sunnyside could be cool and groovy if we treated each other fair. lt's Lotso. He's made us into a pyramid, and he put himself on top! Anyone concur with Ken? l didn't throw you away. Your kid did. Ain't one kid ever loved a toy, really. Chew on that when you're at the dump. Wait! What about Daisy? l don't know what you're talking about. Daisy? You used to do everything with her? Yeah? Then she threw us out. No. She lost you. She replaced us! She replaced you. And if you couldn't have her then no one could. You lied to Big Baby and you've been lying ever since. Where'd you get that? She loved you, Lotso. She never loved me. As much as any kid ever loved a toy. Mama. What? You want your mommy back? She never loved you. Don't be such a baby! Push 'em in. All of 'em! This is what happens when you dummies try to think. We're all just trash, waiting to be thrown away! That's all a toy is! Hey, stop it! Put me down, you idiot! No! No! Wait a minute! Big Baby, wait! He's gone! Holy cow. Come on. Hurry! For crying out loud! Cowboy, hurry! Woody! Oh, boy. lncoming! Come on! Barbie, no! Woody! No! Can you hear me? ls everyone okay?

My boys! Daddy! Hey! Where's that fur ball Lotso? Yeah. l'd like to loosen his stitchin'. Forget it, guys. He's not worth it. Hey! What you got? l had me one of these when l was a kid. Strawberries. Hey, buddy. You might wanna keep your mouth shut. Come on, Woody. We gotta get you home. That's right, college boy. Wait. What about you guys? l mean, maybe the attic's not such a great idea.

Now Slinky here is as loyal as any dog you could want. And Hamm, he'll keep your money safe, but he's also one of the most dastardly villains of all time, evil Dr. Pork Chop. These little dudes are from a strange alien world. Pizza Planet. And this is Buzz Lightyear, the coolest toy ever! Look, he can fly and shoot lasers! He's sworn to protect the galaxy from the evil Emperor Zurg. To infinity and beyond! Now, you gotta promise to take good care of these guys. They mean a lot to me. My cowboy! Woody? What's he doing in there? There's a snake in my boot. Wha.? There's a snake in my boot. Now, Woody, he's been my pal for as long as l can remember. He's brave, like a cowboy should be. And kind. And smart. But the thing that makes Woody special is he'll never give up on you. Ever. He'll be there for you, no matter what. You think you can take care of him for me? Okay then. Oh, no! Dr. Pork Chop's attacking the haunted bakery! The ghosts are getting away. Woody'll stop 'em! Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! And we'll actually need the rocket. They're getting away!

Mailman! And the sheriff! Okay. Bye, toys! Yeehaw! Sheriff Jessie! Giddyup, Bullseye! They went that way! Chase them! What a beautiful hat shop! You have so many hats. Wow. They're doing hat shop. When's the last time we ever got to play that? Remember when she played house? I liked house. Those were the days. It was basic. You made a house, you lived in it, done. Hmm. That's the third time you haven't been picked this week. I don't know. I don't keep count. Oh, you don't have to. I'll do it for you. Okay, okay, okay, I get it. It's been a while. Oh, looky there. You got your first dust bunny. Aw, how adorable. What you gonna name it? Uh, what about Dusty? Francis! Harry! Karen! Fuzzball! LeBron? No, Fluffy. How about Thumper? Tumbleweed! Tumbleweed. Oh, that's good. That's good. He's a cowboy, so that makes a lot of sense. So many choices. I just can't decide! Bonnie? What are you doing? We gotta go. You don't wanna be late for kindergarten orientation, do you? But I don't wanna go. We talked about this. We're gonna meet your teachers, see your classroom. Can I bring a toy? Toys don't go to school, that's the rule. Freeze! Nobody move! Bonnie always forgets something. She'll be back any second. That goes for you, too, Hamm. But it's money! You all right, Woody? I'm sure she'll pick you next time. Oh, come on, I'm fine. No problem. Hey, Woody. Here. Oh, thanks, Jessie. We're here for you, buddy. I don't want to play the baker. Pricklepants. The hat shop owner is the role I was born to play! All right, Pricklepants, back to your bakery. Excuse me, Dolly? Woody, can't you see I'm threatening everyone? Go back to the closet. Yeah, I know, I know. It's just. I'm worried about Bonnie. A toy should go with her to orientation. Didn't you hear Dad? You'll get Bonnie in trouble. Yeah, but kindergarten is so different. It can be too much for a kid. Having a buddy with them to get through it can really help things. I remember with Andy, I would go to school with him. Uhhuh. I'm sorry, Woody, I hate to sound like a broken record. but Bonnie's not Andy. No, no, no, of course, I get that. But if you would just. Places, everyone! Bonnie? What are you doing back there? Come on, we have to go. That's my big girl. Come on. We gotta hurry, okay? Don't forget your backpack. You're gonna have so much fun. All right. Now what was it you were saying, Woody? Woody? Here we are. Bonnie, honey, it'll be okay. Hi! Are you Bonnie? My name is Miss Wendy. I'm going to be your kindergarten teacher. We have a special place where you can put your backpack. You want to see? Here we are, Bonnie. Just for you. Okay, class, let's all find a seat at a table. so we can start craft time. On the first day of school, you'll need a place to put your pencils. So, today, we're going to make pencil holders. Now, everyone take a cup. and we'll use the art supplies to decorate them. Hi. Bonnie. That is so clever. Hello, I'm Forky. Nice to meet you! Well, hello, Forky, it's nice to meet you. I'm Miss Wendy. Mom! Dad! Look what I made! His name is Forky! Wow! That is so cool! I finished kindergarten! Uh. No. That was just orientation. But for being such a brave girl, we have a surprise for you. What is it? Since school doesn't start for another week, we are going on a road trip! Can I bring Forky? 'Course you can! Yay! And they said I shouldn't go to school with Bonnie. We got this kindergarten thing under control, eh? I can't believe I'm talking to a spork. Hi, toys! Bye, toys! Ow. He did go to kindergarten! I knew it. No, no, no, guys, listen. You tryin' to get Bonnie in trouble? No, of course not! You could have been confiscated. What does that mean? Taken away. No! Or worse. You could've been lost! No, no, no, guys, listen. Bonnie had a great day in class. and we're going on a road trip. Road trip? Vacation! Yeehaw! But then something really weird happened. Bonnie made a friend in class. What a kid. Oh, she's already making friends. No, no. She literally made a new friend. Hey, it's okay. Come on out. That's it. Come on, there you go. Come on, let's get you out of there. You got this. Good. Good. Everyone, I want you to meet Forky. Golly bob howdy! Look at that! Look how long his arms are! Trash? No. No, toys. They're all toys. Trash? No, no, no. That's the trash. These are your friends. Hi! Trash! No, no, it's okay. Trash! Woody, I have a question. Um, well, actually, not just one, I have all of them. I have all the questions. Uh, why does he want to go to the trash? Because he was made from trash. Trash! Look, I know this is a little strange, but you gotta trust me on this. Trash? Forky is the most important toy to Bonnie right now. Important? He's a spork. Yes. Yeah, I know, but this spork. this toy is crucial to Bonnie getting adjusted to kindergarten. Oh. Woody, aren't you being a little dramatic about all this? I know this is new to everybody. but you should see how much this little guy means to Bonnie. When she started playing with him. she had the biggest smile on her face. I wish you could have seen it. Bonnie was really upset. and I swear, once she made Forky. it was a complete transformation. Uh, Woody? Just a second, Jessie. So, we all have to make sure nothing happens to him. Something happened to him. Oh, Chutes and Ladders! Ah, trash. No, no, no! No! No! You're a toy now, Forky! Come on! Stop! Stop it! Hey! No, no, no! Come on! Trash! Trash! Trash! Well, I guess I'll just babysit him till he's used to the room. Hmm. Forky? Where are you, Forky? There you are! I thought I'd lost you, silly. No, no, no. Big girl scary! Like I said before, Bonnie's not scary. She loves you and you need to. Ooh. Forky? Bonnie! Let's go! Rise and shine! Who wants to go on a road trip? Me! I'm gonna bring Dolly, and Buttercup. and Forky, and. Forky? Where are you? He's gotta be here somewhere. Forky? Forky! Come on. Let's eat some breakfast and hit the road! Let's go, Forky! Whoa. He's quite a handful, Woody. You need help with him on the road trip? No. No, no. I got it, I got it. We'll just be stuck in an RV. He can't get far. I got this. I got it. I can't let you I can't let you I can't let you throw yourself away I can't let you I can't let you I can't let you throw yourself away Don't you want to see the sun come up each morning? No, no! Don't you want to see the sun go down each day? Don't you want to see that little girl that loves you so? Her heart would break Oh, yeah! If you should go I can't let you I can't let you I can't let you throw yourself away No, no, no! No! No! No! So it seems to me like you're never gonna behave yourself Since I'm not gonna do this every day Come tomorrow, you're gonna have to save yourself Got nothing more to say You're not listening anyway I can't let you I can't let you Trash, here I come! I can't let you throw yourself away Come on. I can't let you I can't let you I can't let you throw yourself away I don't wanna be a toy! I can't let you I can't let you I can't let you throw yourself away Hey, buddy. Hey, Buzz. You doing okay? I don't know, Buzz. I know you weren't around when Andy was little. but I don't remember it being this hard. Want me to take the next watch? I'll keep an eye on Forky. No, no. I need to do this. That little voice inside me would never leave me alone if I gave up. Huh. Who do you think it is? Who? The voice inside of you. Who do you think it is? Uh. Me. You know, my conscience? That part of you that tells you things? What you're really thinking? Fascinating. So, your inner voice advises you. What? It's a secret mission in uncharted space. Let's go. Where's Forky? Oh, no! Forky! Forky! I am not a toy! I'm a spork. Be quiet! I was made for soup, salad. maybe chili, and then the trash. I'm litter! Freedom! Hamm, how far to our next stop? 5.32 miles, give or take. I can make that. I'll meet you at the RV park. Woody, hold on a minute. Woody! Forky! Forky, where are you? Forky! Forky, where are you? Carry me? No. Why do I have to be a toy? Because you have Bonnie's name written on the bottom of your sticks. Why do I have Bonnie's name written on the bottom of my sticks? Because she. Look, she plays with you all the time, right? Ugh. Yes. And who does she sleep with every night? The big white fluffy thing? No, not her pillow. You. All right, Forky. You have to understand how lucky you are right now. You're Bonnie's toy. You are going to help create happy memories. that will last for the rest of her life. Huh? What? Okay. Doing it for Bonnie. Doing this for Bonnie, you're doing it for Bonnie. Okay, like it or not, you are a toy. Maybe you don't like being one, but you are one nonetheless. Which means you are going to be there for Andy when he. Who's Andy? I mean, Bonnie. You have to be there for Bonnie. That is your job. Well, what's your job? Well, right now, it's to make sure you do yours. Carry me? No! Who's Andy? Andy was my other kid. You had another kid? Yeah, yeah. For a long time. And it was pretty great. I was a favorite toy, actually. Running the room was my job. Keeping all the toys in place. So, he thought Andy's room was a planet? Wow, that is messed up. Right! That's exactly what I thought when he first showed up. Yeah. I mean, how is that not annoying? Thank you! Seriously, that is the. Well, then you watch 'em grow up and become a full person. And then they leave. They go off and do things you'll never see. Don't get me wrong, you still feel good about it. But then somehow you find yourself, after all those years. sitting in a closet just feeling. Useless? Yeah. Your purpose fulfilled? Exactly. Woody, I know what your problem is. You do? You're just like me. Trash! What is it with you and trash? It's warm. Ew. It's cozy. I guess. And safe! Like somebody's whispering in your ear, Everything's gonna be okay. Forky, that's it. That's how Bonnie feels when she's with you. She does? Yes! Wait a sec. You mean she thinks I'm warm? Yep. And cozy? Uhhuh. And sometimes kinda squishy? Well, that, too. Yes. I get it now. I'm Bonnie's trash. Yes! Wait, what? I am Bonnie's trash! No, no, no, not exactly. She must be feeling awful without me. Woody, we got to get going, she needs me! Yeah. Whoa, whoa. Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming! Forky, slow down! Forky! Bonnie, I'm coming! Forky! Forky, look. Bonnie's right over there. Hurry! Whoo! Huh? Woody? Bo? Woody? Aren't we going to Bonnie? I know, I know. But my friend might be in there. Friend? Oh, a friend, uh. Well, a friend is. Well, a friend is like you and me. Trash? Trash, like. Yes. And I'm very worried that she might be lost. But, Woody, Bonnie's right there. Yeah, we'll have you back before she wakes up. Come on. Bo? Bo? Bo? Bo? Bo? Bo? Bo. Bo, Bo, Bo. Bo? Bo? Can we go back to Bonnie now? I don't see your friend. Yeah, okay. She's not in here. Come on, let's go. Is that Bo? Uh. Hey, howdy. Hey there. Uh, sorry to bother you, but. Why, you're not a bother at all. We were just out for my early morning stroll. And look. we met you! My name is Gabby Gabby. And this is my very good friend Benson. Oh, uh, Woody. Pleasure to meet you. Well, it's nice to meet you, Woody. And you are.? This is Forky. I'm trash. Our kid made him. Kid? Toys around here don't have kids. Are you two lost? Lost? No, no. But we are looking for a lost toy. She's a figurine. Used to be on that lamp in the window? Name's Bo Peep? Bo Peep? Oh, yes, I know Bo. You do? Hop on in. We'll take you to her. Oh, you don't have to do that. Well, okay. Benson, be careful with our new friends. Wow, what service. Uh. Thank you for your help. I haven't seen Bo in years. May I ask, when were you made? Me? Uh. I'm not sure. Late '50s? Me, too! Gee, I wonder if we were made in the same factory. Wouldn't that be something? I gotta say, you are in great condition. Well, I try to stay active. And look at that, you have a voice box like me. Benson, show him. Oh, that's really not necessary. I'm Gabby Gabby and I love you. Wow, you need to fix that. My record works just fine. It's the voice box that's broken. Does yours still work? Hey! There's a snake in my boot! Listen to that! Let's see it. I bet it's the same type. No, thanks, mine's sewn inside. Is Bo around here? Because we need. Oh. The store is about to open. Don't worry, we'll take you where no one will see us. Oh, no. We can't stay. Yes, you can. We gotta go. You can't leave yet. You have what I need. Right inside there. Returned that lamp the next day. You're kidding me! Mom, can we go to the park now? Harmony! Stop him, please. What's going on? Come on! Let's go! He's coming, he's coming! I see him! Forky? We got to get out of. Woody! I'd like to join your posse, boys. But first, I'm gonna sing a little song. Grandma, look what I found. Can I take it to the park? Sure. Mom, she has enough toys from the store. Oh, it's fine. Nobody buys the toys anyway. Thanks, Grandma! Yeehaw! Mom, can we go to the carnival? We're going to the park. Maybe later, sweetie. Any sign of Woody? I don't see him! Shh! Maybe we should have gone with the fork. The spoon is safer. Mmm. Forky? Where's Forky? Mom! Dad! What's wrong, honey? Are you okay? I can't find Forky! He's missing! Oh, Bonnie, it'll be all right. I'm sure he's here somewhere. You know, if you don't find him, you can make a new one. No! There's only one Forky! Uh. Let's go look outside. Maybe he fell on the ground somewhere. Oh, poor Bonnie. We're gonna find him, okay? We have to find him, Mom. He needs me. Woody was right. We all should have been safeguarding the utensil. Why isn't Woody back yet? Do you think he's lost? Buzz, what do we do? What do we do, Buzz? Buzz, what do we do? What do we do, Buzz? What do we do, Buzz? Buzz! I, uh. Buzz. What would Woody do? Eh, jump out of a moving vehicle. What would Woody do? It's a secret mission in uncharted space. Let's go! I think I have to go. Where? Where you goin'? Why? Should we all go? Are we going? And then what? No time to explain! Attack! No time to explain! Oh, no! Buzz! Okay, what is with everyone jumping out the window? Woody and Forky were last seen on the highway. But where is the highway? The slingshot maneuver is all we've got! Full speed ahead! Thanks, inner voice! Hiya! The highway. On my way, Woody! Rad. Hey! Step right up! Put your money down! Get yourself a real Buzz Lightyear! Hey! Hey! Harmony, honey. Sunscreen. Okay.

Oh, baby! It's a good day to play, huh? Am I right? Huh? Hello, Mr. Cowboy. How are you today? Do you like riding horses? Wanna play on the swings? Wait for me! Bo? Come on. Bo! Oh, I can't believe it's you! Bo Peep! I never thought I'd see you again! So, which kid is yours? Which one is yours? None. No one. Wait, you're a lost toy? You're a lost toy? That's awful. That's great. Huh? I mean, awfully great. that you are lost out here. Skunk, skunk, skunk! Watch out! Huh? I told you not to drive so fast. You almost ran him over. Oh, hey, guys! Whoa! Hold on there! Okay! I missed you, too. If it isn't Bobby? Gus? Uh. Lefty? Billy, Goat, and Gruff. Right! Right! Right! Sorry, guys. Girls. Girls! Of course! All right, all right. Okay, let's get a look at you. You need any repairs? Repairs? No, I'm fine. Hey! Nice find, girls. Where did you get all this stuff? Here and there. You know, some kids play rougher than others. so I try to be prepared. How long have you been out on your own? Seven fantastic years! Seven? You would not believe the things I've seen. Uh, no. Gigs. Yo! Come on out. There's someone I want you to meet. Be right down. What's the situation? We heading out of town or. Whoa! Who's this? You remember the rag doll I told you about? The cowboy? Yep! No way! Don't stare. I'm totally staring. Woody, this is Giggle McDimples. Oh, hi, Giggle. Whoa, you didn't tell me he was a cop. Howdy, Sheriff. Officer Giggle McDimples. I run Pet Patrol for MiniOpolis. Yeah, search and rescue. Ants, caterpillars, miniature poodles, spiders. Hut! Hut! Hut! Carl! Where you headed? Combat Carl just heard there's a birthday party. at the playground on Main Street. Rumor has it they got two pinatas. That could be 20 to 30 kids. Nice! Oh, yeah! Combat Carl's gettin' played with! You guys in? You bet! Woody, you are gonna love this! Uh, no, I can't, sir. Bo, I need to get back to my kid. What? You got a kid? Yeah. Way to beat the odds, soldier. Meet you at the playground, Peep. Combat Carl's got a pinata party to crash. All right, move out. Hut! Hut! Hut! So, you're, uh, with a kid? It's not Andy, is it? No, no, no. He went off to college. But he gave us to Bonnie. You have a little girl? No way! Yeah, yeah. It's why I'm out here. Her other toy is trapped in this antique store, and I have to. Second Chance Antiques? We know that store. That's great. That is great! If you know the store, you could really help me find him. No way. We wasted years there, just sitting on the shelf, collecting dust. Oh, Bo, that's awful. But I don't have a choice. I have to get that toy from Gabby. Whoa. Steer clear of that weirdo. If I were you, I'd cut my losses and go home. But Bonnie needs him to get through kindergarten. Kids lose toys every day. Bonnie will get over it. No, no. You see, Bonnie needs him just like Molly needed you. Aw, no. Sorry, girls. Molly's not here. Molly? Bo, I didn't know you had a kid. That was a long time ago. Oh, Bo's kid was something special. She was the cutest thing. but so afraid of the dark. It was just a phase. Oh, you weren't there in the beginning. Hearing Molly cry each night. it broke every toy's heart. And then, Bo came into the room. Her lamp was the only thing that made Molly feel safe. Mom would let her keep Bo on all night. Ha! Who knew you were such a softy? And Molly would fall asleep with her hand resting on Bo's feet. Okay! Okay. I get it. Bo, my kid really needs this toy. Will you help me? For old times' sake. All right, all right. Thank you! Oh! Oh, thank you! All right. Guess we're doing this. Let's ride! Second Chance Antiques, and step on it. Ow! Hey, hey! Benson, are we finished? Ow! Oh, that feels great! Look at that! Good as new. Yeah. Thank you, uh, Benson. Uh, so, um, when's Woody coming back? Like I said, soon. He won't forget about you. How do you know? You have your child's name written on your feet. Sticks. That makes you a very important toy. That's exactly what Woody says. Hmm. Interesting. Hi, Grandma! We're back! She's back. Who is she? Harmony. Wait a second. she took Woody. Did she lose him? No. My Harmony is perfect. Forky, it's tea time. It's tea time. Whoohoo! What is tea time? Oh, I'll show you. A little bit of milk, two lumps of sugar. I've been practicing. How do I look? Uh. A little higher. Stick out your pinky. Nice! Mmm! Delicious! Harmony, sweetie, I'm leaving. Come give me a hug. Bye, Mom. I love you. When my voice box is fixed. I'll finally get my chance. Now, about our friend Woody. I wanna know everything about him. Oh, yeah, Woody. I've known that guy my whole life. Two days! Hey, did you know that Bonnie was not his first kid? He had this other kid, Andy. And you know what? I don't think he's ever gotten over him. Psst. Hey, Lightyear. Hey, up here, Astroboy. If you think you can just show up and take our top prize spot. you're wrong! Dead wrong! You don't understand. I'm trying to. Cheat the system and get with a kid? Yeah, we know. No, I need.

How you like that, cheater? Huh? Yeah! Oh, to infinity and my foot! Boom! In a galaxy far, far away, you got kicked in the head! Boom! How do I get out of here? This planet is toxic. Closing helmet to conserve oxygen. In the vacuum of space, they cannot hear you scream! Ow! Let go of me! Get off of me! Ooh! So, that's what gravity feel like. Yeah, that's it. Hey, where you going? You better get over here, spaceman! Yeah, put us back up there! Bunny, what are you doing? He's getting away, let's go! I'm trying! Come on! Antique store, here we come!

Easiest way in is the roof. The roof! Let's go antiquing. Hold on! Huh? Whoa! How did you end up here? I thought you were given to a new family. Oh, you know how it goes. Their little girl grew up and didn't need me anymore, so. Oh, I'm sorry, Bo. Eh, who needs a kid's room. when you can have all of this? Whatcha looking at, Sheriff? What? Oh, uh. That wasn't.

Jessie is loving it. Jessie's still with you? Oh, yeah, the whole gang's still together. Well, I mean, most of us. What about Rex? Yeah, yeah, Rex, Bullseye, Slinky. the Potato Heads. Buzz? Yeah, Buzz, too. I cannot wait to see his face when he hears that I found. Bo Peep? Buzz! My old moving buddy! Buzz? It's so good to see you! Woody, it's Bo Peep! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Buzz. Buzz. Buzz. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Three years! Three years! That's how long we've been hanging up there waiting for a kid! Look, I'm sorry about that. You ruined our lives. Shame on you! Who are these guys? Lightyear promised us a kid. You did what? I did not. Hey! Wait a minute! Eat my plush! All right now, come on, stop it! Cut it out now! Come on, guys, break it up. Guys, I have a kid! You got a kid? Like a kidkid? Like a human kid, not a baby goat? Yeah. Now let go of Buzz and come with me. I'll take you to Bonnie.

They're about to leave! Leaving? They can't do that! The panic is attacking me! Hey! Watch it, buddy! What do we do? We have to stop them! How? We could frame Dad for a crime so he goes to jail. Or go back in time and warn Woody about the future. That's crazy. Time is a flat circle. Jessie! I'm sorry, Bonnie. We looked everywhere. But we need to get going now, okay? Can we please leave a note for Forky. so he knows where we're going? He has to go to kindergarten. Huh? Are you kidding me? I can't. Everything is going perfect. I just bought it. Okay! Daddy's going to use some words. How about we go to the carnival? Or maybe check out some of those shops in town? What did you do? We're not going anywhere. If you get my point. Brilliant! That was genius! Nice work, Jessie! I'm sure Buzz and Woody are on their way back right now. Whoa! Forky is in there? Yeah. Now, hold on. I have a question. Who will Bonnie love more? Ducky or me? Say me. No, say Ducky. Ducky. Bunny. Bunny. Okay, guys. Playtime is over. You have to follow my lead. We stay together, we stay quiet. Are we clear? Absolutely. Lead the way. Are you kidding me? Move over. You move over. Quit pushing me. Stop. Shh! Oh, my maker! That sheep has three heads! No, no, no! What? All six eyes just looked into my soul. Gonna have nightmares. That's most likely where your Forky is being kept. All right, this isn't so bad. We just can't be seen by the dummies. Not just the dummies. Her cabinet is surrounded by a moat of exposed aisle. Where Dragon roams. We can handle a cat. No. Not this one. Is that how we look on the inside? There's so much. fluff. So, how do you propose we get up there? We could go straight across. How? That's quite a jump. We know the perfect toy to help. Oh, Bonnie, check it out. Look at all this cool stuff. Bonnie? We gotta get Forky now! Woody, don't. Stick to the plan. 104. Follow me. Roger that. Woody just sits in the closet? With no playtime? Yeah, he told me himself, he's useless. That's awful. Such pretty hair. What are you doing? You need to stick to the plan. But it's Bonnie. She's right. Can we go to the carnival, too? there. Come on. Stay quiet. You better hope the dummies didn't. Whoa! My sheep! What did I say? I lead. You follow. Bo, I'm so sorry. Really. Just tell me how to help. You really wanna help? Then stay out of my way. I'm getting my sheep back. What about the others? Giggle knows what to do. Here you go. That's our objective. We have to get that key. It's the only way inside the cabinet. You can't be serious. How are we supposed to do that? Okay. You know what, leave that to us. We know exactly what to do. Mmmhmm. Aw. Where did you two come from? The keys! Give 'em up now! Where are they? Give us the keys! Give us the keys! Well, we're not doing that. Yeah, yeah, I agree, too visible. It's a good point. Something more subtle. Ooh, what about Winner, winner, chicken dinner? Yes. The keys! Give 'em up now! Where are they? Uh. you're kidding. Really? Okay, okay. You just. All right. Well. Oh, what about the old Plush Rush? There you go! Argh. Where is this going? Shh! Don't interrupt. Okay, right? Uhhuh? Not gonna happen. NO. Okay, do you want the key or not? What is wrong with you? What is wrong with.? We just gave you three brilliant ideas. It's one thing to say no. It's another to offer a reason. How do we get that key? You're kidding! Really? Woody's back? Woody's back? And you're sure it's Bo Peep who's with him? Thank you, Benson. Make sure the others are ready. Woody's back! I'm coming, Bonnie! Bonnie. First, we must prepare for his arrival. Prepare? Have you ever played hideandseek? No. But it sounds complicated. Oh, it's easy. I'll teach you, okay? Okay. The first thing you do is. one of us finds a place to hide. Scary. while the other one counts to ten. then tries to find them. What are we doing? Shh! Just stand there and be quiet! I'll do the talking. Hi, Tinny! Aw, nice to see you, too. Yeah, he's with me. My friend? No, no, no. He's my accessory. Hey, guys. Bo! Long time no see. Couldn't take it out there, huh? Hey, Doug. Saw your better half at the front of the store. Yeah, you mess with the cat, you get the claws. Bo came back! Magic 8Ball was right! Excuse me. Sorry. What are you doing here? I thought the store had no return policy! Bo, help me out. I need a battery. We got to get this wagon train amovin'! Agreed. Help, help, help. Cheater. Have you seen Duke? He's in the back. Look who jumped 40 school buses and landed back into my life. Hi, Duke! Who's the cowboy? Duke, meet Woody. Woody, meet. Duke Caboom. Canada's greatest stuntman. Oh, yeah! Yes! Huh? He's posing. Duke? Duke, we need to. Hold on. One more. Oh, yeah! What brings you back, Peep? We need your help. Gabby Gabby has his toy and my sheep. No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff? Those are my girls. What were you doing getting tangled up with Gabby Gabby? You know better. Yeah, some toy thought it would be a good idea. to wander into the aisle. That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't, does it? Everybody knows the best route is behind the shelves. That would have been a better route, wouldn't it? Wow, this toy sounds like a complete idiot. He does! Wait, are you that toy? So, here's the plan. We need to jump over the aisle to Gabby's cabinet. And you are the toy to do it. No. Duke. Nope. Duke? Duke? Nuhuh. No way! Duke. Duke! Pass. Negative. Duke. Rejected. Oh, please, Mr. Caboom, this is really important. My kid. You have a kid? Uh. Hey, Duke, show us some more poses, what do you say? I had a kid. Oh, no. Rejean. Rejean was so excited when he got me after Christmas. It was the happiest Boxing Day of my life. That's Duke Caboom, riding the amazing Caboom stunt cycle! Caboom! I was ready to finally do what I was made to do. Caboom! But when Rejean realized I couldn'tjump as far as the toy in the commercial. It's a commercial! It's not real! Rejean threw me away! It's not fair! Why, Rejean? Why? Okay, okay. Calm down, Duke. That was a long time ago. Right now, we need the only toy who can crash us onto Gabby's cabinet. Crash? Any Duke Caboom toy can land. but you are the only one that can crash the way you do. I am? Yes! Forget Rejean. Forget your commercial. Be the Duke you are right now. the one who jumps and crashes! Be who I am right now. Who's the Canuck with all the luck? Caboom? Who's the greatest of the Great White North? Caboom! Who's the most spectacular daredevil Canada has ever seen? Duke Caboom! Can you do the jump? Yes, I Canada! Uhhuh. We've got our ride. Yes! Yeehaw! Yo, Bo! Gigs! You made it! Good work! How'd you get it? How do we get that key? It was hard. Very difficult. Barely made it out alive. Yeah. So, you're welcome. Okay. Let's do this. Let me wrap that up for you. Don't want anything to happen to it on the way home. Good. That sale buys us some time. Wait for it. All right, let's go! So, how long were you in here? I don't know. Couple years. I didn't wanna sit on a shelf waiting for my life to happen. So, I left. Wow. You've handled this lost toy life better than I could. Aw, Sheriff. You're selling yourself short. I think you'd make a great lost toy. You really don't think you'll ever be in a kid's room again, huh? Nope. And now with the carnival traveling through, it's our chance to hop a ride. and leave town. You're leaving? Sure am. You ever think about getting out there, seeing the world? Without a kid? No. You can't teach this old toy new tricks. You'd be surprised. So, how'd you end up in this store in the first place? Well, I saw your lamp in the window. and I thought maybe you were inside. and so I, uh. Wow. Yeah. Will you look at that? This is the only part of the store I ever liked. That's gonna be quite a jump for you and Duke. For me? Didn't I tell you? You're going with him. I am? Let's caboom. It'll be fine, Duke's the best. Yeah, at crashing. And now! Go! Whoa! Huh? Rejean. It's a commercial. It's not real! I can't do this! I'm sorry, Rejean! No, no, no! What's new, pussycat? Forky? Girls? Forky, where are you? You're never gonna find me. Forky? Woody! How'd you find me? Bo, I found him! Hi. Wait, it's an actual fork? Bo! Bo! Bo! Buzz! The dummies are gone! What? Where'd they go? Okay, we can go now! No. I need to find my girls. Hello, Woody. Hi, Bo. Where are my sheep? Yeah! Look! Woody found me! Take the bunny! I'm too cute to die! Hiya! Oh, no, no! Woody! I just wanna talk. Yeah, with my voice box! Pull! Whoa! You're my favorite deputy. Somebody's poisoned the water hole. I'd like to join your posse. Reach for the sky! Girls! Drop it. No! No! Forky! We've gotta go! Wait! Forky! Woody! Bonnie's backpack? Ahh! Giggle! Don't let Woody leave! Grab on! Duke, get us out of here! Oui! Here, kitty, kitty! Wait! We don't have Forky! Woody! Forky! Is everyone okay? Shh. It's okay. Shh. It's okay. Bunny? Bunny? Bunny! No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Oh, Bunny! It's gonna be okay. Forky's still in there. If we hurry, we can get him before they lock him up. You want us to go back in there? We barely got out alive. Woody, it's better if we wait. No, no, no. There's no time. We can easily get back inside. But I saw Bonnie's. By my count, there were only four dummies. But the backpack. We outnumber them. So we have the advantage. Woody, look at us! Nobody is with you. It's over, okay? No. No, no, no. We are wasting time. We can do this. Come on, Pullstring. It's not worth it. Yeah, yes, listen to her! Nobody wants this! I do! Why? Because! Why? Just because! Why? Because it's all I have left to do! I don't have anything else. So, the rest of us don't count? That's not what I meant. Bonnie needs Forky. No. You need Bonnie! Open your eyes, Woody. There's plenty of kids out there. It can't be just about the one you're still clinging to. It's called loyalty. Something a lost toy wouldn't understand. I'm not the one who's lost. Let's get out of here. We've got a carnival that leaves in the morning. Come on. Mmmhmm. We'll find our own kid. You're crazy. Bo! Bye, Woody. Good luck with Bonnie. Woody, you did all you could. Time to go home. No. Woody. I don't leave toys behind, Buzz. Yeah, but, Woody, you're actually leaving. Not now. Not ever. And he left me behind. What now, inner voice? Mission accomplished. Return to base. Go back to the RV? What about Woody? We're going home, space ranger. Fall back, this planet. Retreat! There's too. Go! Time to fly! Exit the. Back. Run. Get out! Returning to Star Command. Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot, inner voice. Harmony, honey, help Grandma close up for the night. Okay. Then can we go to the carnival? Sure. Ahhh! Hello, Woody. I knew you'd be back. You don't know me. But I do. You were left in the closet, feeling useless. wondering if you'll ever get played with. I'm not leaving without Forky. Can we agree on just one thing? What? That being there for a child is the most noble thing a toy can do. Okay. I was defective right out of the box. I can only imagine what it must have been like for you. All that time you spent with Andy. riding a bike with him for the first time. comforting him when he skinned his knee. proudly watching him grow up. And then you got a second chance with Bonnie. giving her comfort when she's scared at school. helping her when she needs it most. You've been there through all their ups and downs. Please. Be honest with me. Was it as wonderful as it sounds? It was. All I want is a chance for just one of those moments. I'd give anything to be loved the way you have. Just leave me Forky. Bonnie needs him. Of course. The flat tire is fixed! Come on, Woody, hurry up. Where is he? Buzz! Buzz! Where's Woody? And Forky? We have a situation. They need to be extracted from the antique store. How do we do that? Okay, let's make sure we have everything. Finally. It's okay. Any minute now. Bonnie will notice her backpack is missing. She'll realize she left it at the antique store. and we'll head back in there. Okay. Looks like we have everything. You good, Bonnie? Yup. Great. Let's get out of here. Okay, genius, what do we do now? Hmm. Scanning perimeter. Laser at full power! Buzz, what are you doing? I'm thinking. Honey, will you please shut that toy off? Yeah, I got it. Attack! Meteor shower! Look out! It's a secret mission in uncharted space! Let's go! Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Bonnie, how do you turn this off? Full speed ahead! Open the pod bay doors! I don't know. It's just you and me now, cadet. A distress signal is coming from that rocket. Just toss it in the drawer. To infinity and beyond! Uhoh. Uh, your backpack's in the antique store! Let's go! Oh, no, my backpack! I left my backpack in the antique store! You did? All right, let's swing by and get it. Ugh! I can't believe the nerve of that cowboy. I mean, who does he think he is? Exactly! He was way out of line. You did the right thing leaving him behind. Hey, Lamb Chops? Hmm. Coast is clear. Oh. Head to the middle. When the carnival leaves tomorrow, we'll hide right there. Uh, no way! Stuff that. Awesome. Stick with me. You'll be fine. Ready? No! And another thing, Woody asked you for help. On your mark. And he treats you like that? get set. He only cares about himself. No! You're wrong. Woody's always trying to do right by his kid. By putting everyone in danger. Ugh. That kind of crazy loyalty just. You gotta love him for it. Whoa, say what now? Hey, hey, hey, Bo! What's the plan? Fill me in here. Get in! We're going back. We just got here. You heard Bo! We're going back! Move your plush! Let's ride! You're my favorite. Yay! You are my best friend. Let's play all day! Oh, Benson! Did you hear that? Isn't that lovely? Time for tea. Oh, thank you, Woody. Thank you! All my dreams are coming true because of you. Thank you! Thank you! Uh, you're welcome. It's time, Benson. Goodbye, Forky. I'm going to miss our talks. Me, too. Good luck, Gabby. Thank you, my little utensil. Bye, Gabby! Goodbye, Benson! He is terrifying. Hello. Hi. Bonnie? Can I help you with anything? Yeah. We called about the backpack. Oh, yes. I couldn't find it. Feel free to look around. Quick! Before she finds it! Look! There's Harmony. You make me so happy! Let's be best friends. Oh, this is it! We're going home, Forky! Huh? Forky! Oh! No, no, no. Woody, look! It's really happening! I'm Gabby Gabby, and I love you. I'm gonna cry. Oh, what have you got there? I found this old doll. You can take it home if you want. Nah. What happened? Gabby was supposed to be her toy. There's my backpack! Mom, it's over here. Forky! Mom, I found him! Oh, there he is! Now, please leave him in there, so he doesn't get lost again. But what about Gabby? Forky, listen to me very carefully. This is important. Tell Buzz to get the RV to the merrygoround. You understand? Absolutely. What is a merrygoround? The spinny ride with lights and horses. Oh. You mean a carousel. Yes! Carousel. Yes! Meet me at the carousel. Got it. Gabby! Hey, Gabby! You can have your voice box back. I don't need it anymore. Oh, yes, you do. Harmony wasn't your only chance, Gabby, but we have to hurry. Come on. No. Harmony was my chance. My time's over. Now, please go away. You hear that? A friend once told me. There are plenty of kids out there. And one of them is named Bonnie. She's waiting for you, right now. She just doesn't know it yet. What if you're wrong? Well, if you sit on a shelf the rest of your life. you'll never find out, will you? He's right. I learned that from the best. Come on, Gabby. Let's get you to Bonnie. The carousel? Yeah, it's the spinny ride with lights and horses. Woody said to meet him there. You gotta be kidding! How do we do that? Oh! We could, uh. We are not sending Dad to jail. You're no fun. Left turn in 0. 5 miles. Wait a second. I have an idea. Skunk! Skunk! Too many people. Gonna need an alternate route. Will we make it to the carousel in time? Yes, we Canada! What? What is it? Recalculating. Take a right. What? A right? Right turn ahead. Huh. Does the GPS sound funny to you? Honey, it's fine. Just drive. Hmm, I thought it sounded funny. Another right! Right. Take another right. Huh? Another right? Really? Turn right! Now! Turn right! We're headin' back. There's the carousel! Do you think Woody will get there in time? Nope. Forget it. Never. No. No way. Declined. No dice. Rejected. Duke, Duke, you got this. This is the fastest way to the carousel. You made the last jump. Yeah, but that was 4 feet. This is 40! Exactly! Duke Caboom would never repeat a stunt. No. He'd never do that. No, no, no. He's the toy that went on to crash 40 feet into that target! Yeah, he is. I'm Duke Caboom! Oh, man. I can do this! Yes, you Canada! I can do it with my eyes closed. Yes, you. What? Three, two, one. Go! What? No, wait! What is he doing? Oh, no. This is for you, Rejean. Caboom. Yes! He did it! All right, our turn! You heard the sheriff. Let's go. Yeehaw! Another right! Another right?

I don't know what's happening! I'm so nervous. What if she doesn't like me? Gabby. I don't know if I can do this. Gabby, it's just like you said. This is the most noble thing a toy can do. Okay. Just edge yourself a bit into the light. Not too far. That's it. Perfect. Winner, winner. Chicken dinner. Are you lost, too? I'm Gabby Gabby. Will you be my friend? I'll help you. Excuse me, can you. Can you help us? Oh, honey, what's wrong? I can't find my mom and dad. It's okay. I'll help you find them. I'm sure they're not far. She was right next to us. She was right here!
