Born of cold And winter air And mountain rain combining This icy force both foul and fair Has a frozen heart worth mining Cut through the heart Cold and clear Strike for love and strike for fear There's beauty and there's danger here Split the ice apart Beware the frozen heart Come on, Sven. Elsa. Psst! Elsa! Wake up. Wake up. Wake up! Anna, go back to sleep. I just can't. The sky is awake, so I'm awake. So, we have to play. Go play by yourself. Do you want to build a snowman?

I'm sorry, Anna! Oh. She's ice cold. I know where we have to go. Ice? Faster, Sven. Sven! Please! Help! It's my daughter. It's the king. Trolls? Shush! I'm trying to listen. Cuties. I'm going to keep you. Your Majesty. Born with the powers, or cursed? Born. And they're getting stronger. Here, here. You are lucky it wasn't her heart. The heart is not so easily changed. But the head can be persuaded. Do what you must. I recommend we remove all magic. Even memories of magic, to be safe. But don't worry. I'll leave the fun. She will be okay. But she won't remember I have powers? It's for the best. Listen to me, Elsa. Your power will only grow. There is beauty in it. But also great danger. You must learn to control it. Fear will be your enemy. No! We'll protect her. She can learn to control it. I'm sure. Until then. We'll lock the gates. We'll reduce the staff. We will limit her contact with people, and keep her powers hidden from everyone. Including Anna. Ah. Elsa? Do you wanna build a snowman? Come on, let's go and play I never see you anymore Come out the door It's like you've gone away We used to be best buddies And now we're not I wish you would tell me why Do you wanna build a snowman? It doesn't have to be a snowman Go away, Anna. Okay, bye The gloves will help. See? Conceal it. Don't feel it. Don't let it show. Do you wanna build a snowman? Or ride our bike around the halls? I think some company is overdue I've started talking To the pictures on the walls Hang in there, Joan. It gets a little lonely All these empty rooms Just watching the hours tick by I'm scared. It's getting stronger! Getting upset only makes it worse. Calm down. No! Don't touch me! Please, I don't want to hurt you. See you in two weeks! Do you have to go? You'll be fine, Elsa. Your Highness. Elsa?

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Um. Whew. Hi. Again. Oh, boy! This is awkward. Not You're awkward, but just because we're. I'm awkward, you're gorgeous. Wait, what? I'd like to formally apologize for hitting the princess of Arendelle with my horse. And for every moment after. No! No, no. It's fine. I'm not that princess. I mean, if you had hit my sister Elsa, it would be. Yeesh! Because, you know. Hello. But, lucky you, it's just me. Just you? The bells. The coronation. I better go. I have to go. I better go. Uh. Bye! Oh, no. Oh! Your Majesty, the gloves. Queen Elsa of Arendelle. Queen Elsa of Arendelle! Queen Elsa of Arendelle. Princess Anna of Arendelle. Oh. Here? Are you sure? Because I don't think I'm supposed to. Oh. Okay. Hi. Hi me? Oh. Um. Hi. You look beautiful. Thank you. You look beautifuller. I mean, not fuller. You don't look fuller. But more beautiful. Thank you. So. This is what a party looks like. It's warmer than I thought. What is that amazing smell? Chocolate. Your Majesty. The Duke of Weaseltown. Weselton! Duke of Weselton, Your Majesty. As your closest partner in trade it seems only fitting that I offer you your first dance as queen. Onetwo, and jump. Uh. Thank you. Only, I don't dance. Oh. But my sister does. What? Oh! Lucky you. Oh, I don't think. If you swoon, let me know. I'll catch you. Sorry. Like an agile peacock. Ow! Ow. Speaking of, so great to have the gates open. Why did they shut them in the first place? Do you know the reason? Hmm? No. No. All right. Hang on! They don't call me the Little Dipper for nothing! Ohho! Like a chicken with the face of a monkey, I fly. Your Majesty. Let me know when you're ready for another round, Milady. Well, he was sprightly. Especially for a man in heels. Are you okay? I've never been better. This is so nice. I wish it could be like this all the time. Me, too. But it can't. Why not? It just can't. Excuse me for a minute. I'd be honored. Glad I caught you. Hans. Oop. I often had a whole parlor to myself to slide! Oh! Oops! Sorry. Your physique helps, I'm sure, too. Ah. What's this? Uh, I was born with it. Although, I dreamed I was kissed by a troll. I like it. Yeah, the whole thing. You got it. Okay, wait, wait. So, you have how many brothers? Twelve older brothers. Three of them pretended I was invisible, literally, for two years. That's horrible. It's what brothers do. And sisters. Elsa and I were really close when we were little. But then, one day, she just shut me out, and I never knew why. I would never shut you out. Okay, can I just say something crazy? I love crazy. All my life has been A series of doors in my face And then suddenly I bump into you I was thinking the same thing, because, like. I've been searching my whole life To find my own place And maybe it's the party talking Or the chocolate fondue But with you But with you I found my place I see your face And it's nothing like I've ever known before Love is an open Door! Love is an open Door Door Love is an open door With you With you With you With you Love is an open door I mean, it's crazy What? We finish each other's Sandwiches That's what I was gonna say! I've never met someone Who thinks so much like me Jinx! Jinx again! Our mental synchronization Can have but one explanation You And I Were Just Meant to be Say goodbye Say goodbye To the pain of the past We don't have to feel it anymore Love is an open door Love is an open Door Door Life can be so much more With you With you With you With you Love is an open Door Door Can I say something crazy? Will you marry me? Can I say something even crazier? Yes! Coming through. Excuse me. Oh. Pardon. Sorry. Oh! Can we just get around you there? Thank you. Oh! There she is. Elsa! I mean, Queen. Me again. Um. May I present Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Your Majesty. We would like. Uh, your blessing. Of our marriage. Marriage? Yes! I'm sorry, I'm confused. Well, we haven't worked out all the details ourselves. We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony. Of course, we'll have soup, roast and ice cream. And then. Wait. Would we live here? Here? Absolutely! Anna! Oh! We can invite all 12 of your brothers to stay with us. What? No, no, no. Of course we have the room. Wait, slow down. No one's brothers are staying here. No one is getting married. Wait, what? May I talk to you, please? Alone. No. Whatever you have to say, you can say to both of us. Fine. You can't marry a man you just met. You can if it's true love. Anna, what do you know about true love? More than you. All you know is how to shut people out. You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no. Now, excuse me. Your Majesty, if I may ease your. No, you may not. And I think you should go. The party is over. Close the gates. Yes, Your Majesty. What? Elsa, no, no! Wait. Give me my glove! Elsa, please, please. I can't live like this anymore! Then leave. What did I ever do to you? Enough, Anna. No, why? Why do you shut me out? Why do you shut the world out? What are you so afraid of? I said, enough! Sorcery. I knew there was something dubious going on here. Elsa. There she is! Yes! It is her! Queen Elsa. Our beautiful queen! Your Majesty? Are you all right? No. There she is! Stop her! Please, just stay away from me. Stay away. Monster. Monster! Elsa! Elsa! Wait, please! Elsa, stop! Anna! No. The fjord. Snow! Snow? Yes, snow. Are you all right? No. Did you know? No. Look, it's snowing. It's snowing! The queen has cursed this land! She must be stopped! You have to go after her. Wait, no! You! Is there sorcery in you, too? Are you a monster, too? No, no. I'm completely ordinary. That's right, she is. In the best way. And my sister is not a monster. She nearly killed me! You slipped on ice. Her ice. It was an accident. She was scared. She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this. Tonight was my fault. I pushed her. So, I'm the one that needs to go after her. What? Bring me my horse, please. Anna, no. It's too dangerous. Elsa is not dangerous. I'll bring her back, and I'll make this right. I'm coming with you. No, I need you here to take care of Arendelle. On my honor. I leave Prince Hans in charge. Are you sure you can trust her? I don't want you getting hurt. She's my sister. She would never hurt me. The snow glows white On the mountain tonight Not a footprint to be seen A kingdom of isolation And it looks like I'm the queen The wind is howling Like this swirling storm inside Couldn't keep it in Heaven knows I tried Don't let them in Don't let them see Be the good girl You always have to be Conceal, don't feel Don't let them know Well, now they know Let it go! Let it go! Can't hold it back anymore Let it go! Let it go! Turn away and slam the door I don't care What they're going to say Let the storm rage on The cold never bothered me anyway It's funny how some distance Makes everything seem small And the fears that once controlled me Can't get to me at all It's time to see what I can do To test the limits and break through No right, no wrong No rules for me I'm free! Let it go! Let it go! I am one with the wind and sky Let it go! Let it go! You'll never see me cry Here I stand And here I'll stay Let the storm rage on My power flurries through the air Into the ground My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals All around And one thought crystallizes Like an icy blast I'm never going back The past is in the past Let it go! Let it go! And I'll rise like the break of dawn Let it go! Let it go! That perfect girl is gone Here I stand In the light of day Let the storm rage on! The cold never bothered me anyway Elsa! Elsa! Elsa, it's me, Anna, your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. Of course, none of it would have happened if she had just told me her secret. She's a stinker. Whoa! Oh, no. No, no, no! Come back! No, no, no! Okay. Snow. It had to be snow. She couldn't have had tropical magic that covered the fjords in white sand and warm. Fire! Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold. Ooh. And sauna! Yoohoo. Hmm? Big summer blowout. Half off swimming suits, clogs, and a sun balm of my own invention, yah? Oh. Great. For now, um, how about boots? Winter boots and dresses? That would be in our winter department. Oh. Um. I was just wondering. Has another young woman. The queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here? The only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear. You and this fellow. Yoohoo. Big summer blowout. Carrots. Huh? Behind you. Oh! Right. Excuse me. Oh. A real howler in July, yes? Wherever could it be coming from? The North Mountain. North Mountain. That will be 40. Forty? No, 10. Oh, dear, that's no good. See, this is from our winter stock, where supply and demand have a big problem. You want to talk about a supply and demand problem? I sell ice for a living. Ooh. That's a rough business to be in right now. I mean, that is really. That's unfortunate. Still 40. But I will throw in a visit to Oaken's sauna. Yoohoo. Hi, family. Yoohoo! Ten is all I got. Help me out. Okay. Ten will get you this and no more. Okay, just tell me one thing. What was happening on the North Mountain? Did it seem magical? Yes! Now, back up while I deal with this crook, here. What did you call me? Okay, okay. I'm out. Whoa! Byebye. No, Sven, I didn't get your carrots. But I did find us a place to sleep. And it's free. I'm sorry about this violence. I will add a quart of lutefisk, so we have good feelings. Just the outfit and the boots, yah? Uh. Reindeers are better than people Sven, don't you think that's true? Yeah, people will beat you And curse you and cheat you Every one of them's bad, except you Aw. Thanks, buddy. But people smell better than reindeers Sven, don't you think I'm right? That's once again true For all, except you You got me Let's call it a night Good night Don't let the frostbite Bite Nice duet. It's just you. What do you want? I want you to take me up the North Mountain. I don't take people places. Let me rephrase that. Hey. Take me up the North Mountain. Please. Look, I know how to stop this winter. We leave at dawn. And you forgot the carrots for Sven. Oops, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't. We leave now. Right now. Whew! Hang on! We like to go fast. I like fast. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Get your feet down. This is fresh lacquer. Seriously, were you raised in a barn? Ugh! No, I was raised in a castle. Hmm. So, uh, tell me, what made the queen go all icecrazy? Oh. Well. It was all my fault. I got engaged, but then she freaked out, because I'd only just met him, you know, that day. And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage, and. Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met that day? Yeah. Anyway, I got mad, and so she got mad, and then she tried to walk away, and I grabbed her glove. Hang on! You mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met that day? Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is, she wore the gloves all the time so, I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt. Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers? Yes, they did. But Hans is not a stranger. Oh, yeah? What's his last name? Of the Southern Isles. What's his favorite food? Sandwiches. Best friend's name? Probably John. Eye color? Dreamy. Foot size? Foot size doesn't matter. Have you had a meal with him yet? What if you hate the way he eats? What if you hate the way he picks his nose? Picks his nose? And eats it. Excuse me, sir. He is a prince. All men do it. Ew. Look, it doesn't matter. It's true love. It doesn't sound like true love. Are you some sort of love expert? No. But, uh, I have friends who are. You have friends who are love experts? I'm not buying it. Stop talking. No, no, no. No, no. I'd like to meet these. No, I mean it. Sven, go. Go! What are they? Wolves. Wolves? What do we do? I got this. You just. Don't fall off, and don't get eaten. But I want to help! No. Why not? Because I don't trust your judgment. Excuse me? Who marries a man she just met? It's true love! Whoa! Whoa. Whoa! Christopher! It's Kristoff! Ow! Duck! You almost set me on fire! But I didn't. Get ready to jump, Sven! You don't tell him what to do. Hey! I do! Jump, Sven! Phew! But I just paid it off. Uhoh. No. No. No! Ah! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Grab on! Pull, Sven. Pull! Whoa. I'll replace your sled, and everything in it. And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore. Of course I don't want to help her anymore. In fact, this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again. It's this way? She'll die on her own. I can live with that. Here we go. But you won't get your new sled if she's dead. I think, actually, it's up. Sometimes, I really don't like you. Hold up! We're coming. You are? I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along. Arendelle. It's completely frozen. But it will be fine. Elsa will thaw it. Will she? Yeah. Now, come on. This way to the North Mountain? More like this way. I never knew winter could be so beautiful. Yeah. It really is beautiful, isn't it? But it's so white. You know, how about a little color? I'm thinking maybe some crimson, chartreuse. How about yellow? No, not yellow. Yellow and snow? No go. Am I right? Hi. You're creepy. Whoa! I don't want it. Back at you. Please don't drop me. No. Come on, it's just a head. All right. We got off to a bad start. Ew, ew, ew, the body! Wait, what am I looking at right now? Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat? All right, wait one second. Oh. Uh. Oh! Thank you. You're welcome. Now, I'm perfect. Well, almost. It was like my whole life got turned upside down. Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! Head rush! I was just. Are you okay? Are you kidding me? I am wonderful! I've always wanted a nose. So cute. It's like a little baby unicorn. But. Hey! Whoa! Oh. I love it even more. All right, let's start this thing over. Hi, everyone. I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs. Olaf? That's right. Olaf. And you are? Oh. Um. I'm Anna. And who's the funkylooking donkey over there? That's Sven. Uhhuh. And who's the reindeer? Sven. Oh, the. Oh. Okay. That makes things easier for me. Aw, look at him trying to kiss my nose. I like you, too. Olaf. Did Elsa build you? Yeah. Why? Do you know where she is? Fascinating. Yeah. Why? Do you think you could show us the way? Yeah. Why? How does this work? Ow! Stop it, Sven. I'm trying to focus, here. Yeah. Why? I'll tell you why. We need Elsa to bring back summer. Summer? Mmmhmm. Oh. I don't know why, but I've always loved the idea of summer. And sun, and all things hot. Really? I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat. Nope. But sometimes I like to close my eyes, and imagine what it would be like when summer does come. Bees will buzz Kids will blow dandelion fuzz And I'll be doing Whatever snow does in summer A drink in my hand My snow up against the burning sand Probably getting gorgeously tanned In summer I'll finally see a summer breeze Blow away a winter storm And find out what happens to solid water When it gets warm And I can't wait to see What my buddies all think of me Just imagine how much cooler I'll be In summer! The hot and the cold are both so intense Put them together It just makes sense Winter's a good time To stay in and cuddle But put me in summer and I'll be a. Happy snowman! When life gets rough I like to hold on to my dream Relaxing in the summer sun Just letting off steam Oh, the sky Will be blue And you guys will be there, too When I finally do What frozen things do In summer! I'm gonna tell him. Don't you dare. In summer! So, come on! Elsa's this way. Let's go bring back summer! I'm coming! Somebody's gotta tell him. No, no. You've got the bark facing down. The bark needs to be faceup. Bark down is drier. Bark up! Bark down! Papa! Cloak? Does anyone need a cloak? Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness. The castle is open. There is soup and hot glogg in the great hall. Here, pass these out. Prince Hans! Are we expected to just sit here and freeze while you give away all of Arendelle's tradable goods? Princess Anna has given her orders. And that's another thing! Has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress to destroy us all? Do not question the princess. She left me in charge and I will not hesitate to protect Arendelle from treason. Treason? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy. It's Princess Anna's horse. So, where is the princess? Where could she be? Where is she? Princess Anna is in trouble. I need volunteers to go with me to find her. I'll go. I volunteer. I volunteer two men, My Lord. Be prepared for anything. And should you encounter the queen, you are to put an end to this winter. Do you understand? Hmm. So, how exactly are you planning to stop this weather? Oh. I am gonna talk to my sister. That's your plan? My ice business is riding on you talking to your sister? Yep. So, you're not at all afraid of her? Why would I be? Yeah. I bet she's the nicest, gentlest, warmest person ever. Oh. Look at that. I've been impaled. What now? Mmm. It's too steep. I've only got one rope and you don't know how to climb mountains. Says who? Hmm? What are you doing? I'm going to see my sister. You're gonna kill yourself. I wouldn't put my foot there. You're distracting me. Or there. How do you know Elsa even wants to see you? All right. I'm just blocking you out because I gotta concentrate, here. You know, most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone. Nobody wants to be alone. Except maybe you. I'm not alone. I have friends, remember? You mean, the love experts? Yes, the love experts. Ah. Please tell me I'm almost there. Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here? Hang on. Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is gonna solve the problem but I found a staircase that leads exactly where you wanted to go. Haha! Thank goodness. Catch! Thanks. That was like a crazy trust exercise. Whoa. Now, that's ice. I might cry. Go ahead. I won't judge. All right, take it easy, boy. Come here. I got you. Okay. You stay right here, buddy. Flawless. Knock. Just knock. Why isn't she knocking? Do you think she knows how to knock? Huh. It opened. That's a first. Oh. You should probably wait out here. What? The last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything. But, but. Oh, come on! It's a palace made of ice. Ice is my life! Bye, Sven. You, too, Olaf. Me? Just give us a minute. Okay. One, two, Four. Whoa. Elsa? It's me, Anna. Anna. Whoa. Elsa, you look different. It's a good different. And this place. It's amazing. Thank you. I never knew what I was capable of. I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd have known. No, no, no. It's okay. You don't have to apologize, but you should probably go. Please. But I just got here. You belong down in Arendelle. So do you. No, Anna, I belong here. Alone. Where I can be who I am without hurting anybody. Actually, about that. Sixty! Wait. What is that? Hi! I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs! Olaf? Yeah. You built me. Remember that? And you're alive? Um. I think so. He's just like the one we built as kids. Yeah. Elsa, we were so close. We can be like that again. Catch me! Slow down! Anna! No. We can't. Goodbye, Anna. Elsa, wait. No, I'm just trying to protect you. You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid. Please don't shut me out again. Please don't slam the door You don't have to keep Your distance anymore 'Cause for the first time in forever I finally understand For the first time in forever We can fix this hand in hand We can head down this mountain together. You don't have to live in fear 'Cause for the first time in forever I will be right here Anna. Please go back home Your life awaits Go enjoy the sun And open up the gates Yeah, but. I know. You mean well But leave me be Yes, I'm alone But I'm alone and free Just stay away And you'll be safe from me Actually, we're not What do you mean, you're not? I get the feeling you don't know What do I not know? Arendelle's in deep, deep, deep Deep snow What? You kind of set off an eternal winter everywhere. Everywhere? Well, it's okay, you can just unfreeze it. No, I can't. I don't know how. Sure you can. I know you can. 'Cause for the first time in forever Oh, I'm such a fool! I can't be free! You don't have to be afraid No escape from the storm inside of me We can work this out together I can't control the curse! We'll reverse the storm you've made Anna, please you'll only make it worse! Don't panic There's so much fear! We'll make the sun shine bright You're not safe here! We can face this thing together No! We can change this winter weather And everything will be all right I can't! Anna! Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm fine. Who's this? Wait, it doesn't matter. Just. You have to go. No, I know we can figure this out together. How? What power do you have to stop this winter? To stop me? Anna, I think we should go. No, I'm not leaving without you, Elsa. Yes, you are. Stop! Put us down! Go away. Heads up! Watch out for my butt! It is not nice to throw people! Whoa, whoa, whoa, feistypants. Okay, relax. Just calm down! Calm down! Okay! All right! I'm okay. Just let the snowman be. I'm calm. Great. Oh! Come on! Oh. Look, see? Now, you made him mad. I'll distract him. You guys go. No, no! Not you guys! This just got a whole lot harder. Look out! Run! Run! What are you doing? I got him! Whoa! Stop! It's a 100foot drop. It's 200. Ow! What's that for? I'm digging a snow anchor. Okay. What if we fall? There's 20 feet of fresh powder down there. It'll be like landing on a pillow. Hopefully. Okay, Anna. On three. Okay. One. You tell me when. I'm ready to go. Two. I was born ready! Yes! Calm down. Tree! What the. Whoa! That happened. Man, am I out of shape. There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven! Where did you guys go? We totally lost Marshmallow back there. Hey! We were just talking about you. All good things, all good things. No! This is not making much of a difference, is it? Olaf! Hang in there, guys! Go. Go faster! Hey! Ow! Kristoff! Don't come back! We won't. Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow. Olaf! I can't feel my legs! I can't feel my legs! Those are my legs. Ooh! Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt. Oh. That feels better. Hey, Sven! He found us. Who's my cute little reindeer? Don't talk to him like that. You're tickling me. Here. Whoa! Are you okay? Thank you. How's your head? Ah! Ooh! It's fine. Uh. Uh, I'm good. I've got a thick skull. I don't have a skull. Or bones. So, uh. So, now what? Now what? Now what? Oh. What am I gonna do? She threw me out. I can't go back to Arendelle with the weather like this. And then there's your ice business. Hey, hey. Don't worry about my ice business. Worry about your hair! What? I just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair. No, yours is turning white. White? It's. What? It's because she struck you, isn't it? Does it look bad? No. You hesitated. No, I didn't. Anna, you need help, okay? Come on. Okay! Where are we going? To see my friends. The love experts? Love experts? Uhhuh. And don't worry, they'll be able to fix this. How do you know? Because I've seen them do it before. I like to consider myself a love expert. Get it together. Control it. Don't feel. Don't feel. Don't feel. Don't feel! Look, Sven, the sky is awake. Are you cold? A little. Uh. Wait. Come here. Huh? Ooh. So, uh, about my friends. Well. I say friends. They're more like family. Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven. Until they, you know, kinda took us in. They did? Yeah. I don't want to scare you. They can be a little inappropriate and loud. Very loud. They are also stubborn at times, and a little overbearing. And heavy. Really, really, heavy. But you'll get it. They mean well. Kristoff, they sound wonderful. Okay, then. Meet my family. Hey, guys. They're rocks. You are a sight for sore eyes. He's crazy. Rocko's looking sharp, as usual. Clay, whoa. I don't even recognize you. You lost so much weight. I'll distract him while you run. Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to meet you. Because I love you, Anna, I insist you run. I understand you're love experts. Ooh! Why aren't you running? Uh. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go. Go. No, no, no. Anna, wait. Kristoff! Whoa! Hey! Kristoff's home! Kristoff's here! Kristoff's home! Wait, Kristoff? Uhhuh. Ah, let me look at you. Take off your clothes, I wash them. No! No, I'm going to keep my clothes on. Look, it's great to see you all, but where's Granpabbie? He's napping. But look, I grew a mushroom. I. I earned my fire crystal. I passed a kidney stone. Kristoff, pick me up. You're getting big. Good for you. Trolls. They're trolls! He's brought a girl! A girl! Is that a real girl? She's like a little cupcake. What's going on? I've learned to just roll with it. Let me see. Bright eyes, working nose, strong teeth! Yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, um, no. No. You've got the wrong idea. No. That's not why I brought her here. Right. We're not. I'm not. What's the issue, dear? Why are you holding back from such a man? Is it the clumpy way he walks? What? Or the grumpy way he talks? Oh, no. Or the pearshaped, squareshaped Weirdness of his feet? Hey! And though we know he washes well He always ends up sort of smelly But you'll never meet a fella Who's as sensitive and sweet That's nice, but. So, he's a bit of a fixerupper Whoa, whoa, whoa. So, he's got a few flaws Like his peculiar brain, dear His thing with the reindeer That's a little outside of nature's laws This is not about me! So, he's a bit of a fixerupper But this we're certain of You can fix this fixerupper up With a little bit of love Um. Can we please just stop talking about this? We've got a real, actual problem, here. I'll say. So, tell me, dear. Is it the way that he runs scared? Or that he's socially impaired? Or that he only likes To tinkle in the woods? I don't need to know that. Are you holding back your fondness Due to his unmanly blondness? Or the way he covers up That he's the honest goods? He's just a bit of a fixerupper He's got a couple of bugs No, I don't! His isolation is confirmation Of his desperation for healing hugs Aw. So, he's a bit of fixerupper But we know what to do The way to fix up this fixerupper Is to fix him up with you Whoa! Stop it, stop it, stop it! Enough! She is engaged to someone else, okay? So, she's a bit of fixerupper That's a minor thing Her quote engagement Is a flex arrangement And by the way, I don't see no ring So, she's a bit of a fixerupper Hey! Whoa, watch it! Her brain's a bit betwixt Get the fiance out of the way And the whole thing will be fixed We're not saying you can change him 'Cause people don't really change We're only saying that love's a force That's powerful and strange People make bad choices If they're mad or scared or stressed But throw a little love their way Throw a little love their way And you'll bring out their best True love brings out the best Everyone's a bit of a fixerupper That's what it's all about Father! Sister! Brother! We need each other to raise us up And round us out Everyone's a bit of a fixerupper But when push comes to shove The only fixerupper fixer That can fix a fixerupper is. True, true True, true True Love! Love, love, love Love True love True Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded. Wait, what? You're getting married. Love! Anna? She's as cold as ice. There is strange magic here. Granpabbie. Come, come. Bring her here to me. Anna, your life is in danger. There is ice in your heart put there by your sister. If not removed, to solid ice will you freeze, forever. What? No. But you can remove it, right? I cannot. I'm sorry, Kristoff. If it was her head, that would be easy. But only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart. An act of true love? A true love's kiss, perhaps? Something's wrong. Are you all right? Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans. Hans. Pull us out, Sven. Olaf, come on! I'm coming! Let's go kiss Hans! Who is this Hans? We are here to find Princess Anna. Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the queen. Do you understand? Yes, Your Grace. The queen. Go, go! Come on! There! Up there! Come on! We got her. No. Please. Go around. Toss it. Stay away! Look out! Fire! Fire! Get her! Ah! Come on! Grab his arm. Aim. This way, this way! Whoa! Queen Elsa! Don't be the monster they fear you are. Oh, no. What have. What have I done? Why did you bring me here? I couldn't just let them kill you. But I'm a danger to Arendelle. Get Anna. Anna has not returned. If you would just stop the winter. Bring back summer, please. Don't you see? I can't. You have to tell them to let me go. I will do what I can. Just hang in there. Come on, buddy, faster! Oh, boy! Whoa! I'll meet you guys at the castle! Stay out of sight, Olaf. I will! Hello! It's alive! It's Princess Anna! Are you gonna be okay? Don't worry about me. Anna! You had us worried sick. My Lady. Get her warm. And find Prince Hans, immediately. We will. Thank you. Make sure she's safe. Oh, you poor girl, you're freezing. Oh, let's get you inside now and get you warm. I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna. You cannot risk going out there again. If anything happens to her. If anything happens to the princess, you are all Arendelle has left. He's in here. Prince Hans. Anna. You're so cold. Hans, you have to kiss me. What? Now! Now! Slow down. We'll give you two some privacy. What happened out there? Elsa struck me with her powers. You said she would never hurt you. I was wrong. Anna. She froze my heart, and only an act of true love can save me. A true love's kiss. Oh, Anna. If only there was someone out there who loved you. What? You said you did. As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. I knew I would have to marry into the throne somewhere. What. What are you talking about? As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course. But no one was getting anywhere with her. But you. Hans! You were so desperate for love, you were willing to marry me just like that. I figured after we married, I would have to stage a little accident for Elsa. Hans! No. Stop. But then, she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her. Please. All that's left now is to kill Elsa, and bring back summer. You're no match for Elsa. No, you're no match for Elsa. I, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save Arendelle from destruction. You won't get away with this. Oh. I already have. Please, somebody, help. Please. Please. It's getting colder by the minute. If we don't do something soon, we'll all freeze to death. Prince Hans. Princess Anna is. Dead. What? What happened to her? She was killed. By Queen Elsa. No! Her own sister. At least we got to say our marriage vows before she died in my arms. There can be no doubt now. Queen Elsa is a monster, and we are all in grave danger. Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you. With a heavy heart, I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason. And sentence her to death. Hurry up! She's dangerous. Careful. It won't open! It's frozen shut. Put your back into it! Come on! Push! What is it, buddy? Hey, watch it. What's wrong with you? I don't understand you when you talk like that. Stop it! Put me down! No, Sven! We're not going back. She's with her true love. What the. Anna! Come on! Come on, boy. Help. Anna! Oh, no. Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there. Wow! So, this is heat. I love it. Ooh! But don't touch it. So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss? I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love. But we ran all the way here. Please, Olaf, you can't stay here. You'll melt. I am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save you. Do you happen to have any ideas? I don't even know what love is. That's okay, I do. Love is putting someone else's needs before yours. Like, you know, how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans and left you forever. Kristoff loves me? Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you? Olaf, you're melting. Some people are worth melting for. Just maybe not right this second. Don't worry, I've got it. We're gonna get through. Oh, wait. Hang on, I'm getting something. It's Kristoff and Sven! They're coming back this way. They. They are? Wow! He's really moving fast. I guess I was wrong. I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind. Help me up, Olaf. Please. No, no, no! You need to stay by the fire and keep warm. I need to get to Kristoff. Why? Oh, I know why! There's your act of true love right there! Riding across the fjords like a valiant, pungent reindeer king! Come on! Look out! Oh! Uh. Back this way. We're trapped. Oh. Whoa! Slide, Anna! We made it! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Come on, buddy, faster. Kristoff! Keep going! Kristoff! Come on! No. Whoa! Whoa! Sven. Sven! Good boy. Kristoff. Kristoff. Anna. Anna! Elsa! You can't run from this! Just take care of my sister. Your sister? She returned from the mountain weak and cold. She said that you froze her heart. No. I tried to save her, but it was too late. Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white. Your sister is dead. Because of you. No. Kristoff. Anna! Elsa? No! Anna! Oh. Anna! No, no! Please, no. Anna? Anna? Oh, Elsa. You sacrificed yourself for me? I love you. An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart. Love will thaw. Love. Of course. Elsa? Love! I knew you could do it. Hands down, this is the best day of my life. And, quite possibly, the last. Oh, Olaf! Hang on, little guy. Oh, oh, oh! My own personal flurry! Uhuhuhuh. Anna? But she froze your heart. The only frozen heart around here is yours. Wonderful! Setting course, sir. I will return this scoundrel to his country. We shall see what his 12 big brothers think of his behavior. Arendelle thanks you, milord. This is unacceptable. I am a victim of fear. I've been traumatized. Ah! My neck hurts. Is there a doctor that I could see? And I demand to see the queen! Oh. I have a message from the queen. Arendelle will henceforth and forever no longer do business of any sort with Weaseltown. Weselton. It's Weselton! Let's go. Come on, come on, come on! Okay, okay, here I come. Pole! Whoops! Sorry. Okay, okay. Here we are. Oh! I owe you a sled. Are you serious? Yes! And it's the latest model. No, I can't accept this. You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders. She's named you the Official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer. What? That's not a thing. Oh, sure it is. And it even has a cup holder. Do you like it? Like it? I love it! Whoa. I could kiss you! I could. I mean, I'd like to. I'd. May I? We me. I mean, may we? Wait, what? We may. Mmm. Summer! Ooh. Hello. Are you ready? Ice! Ooh! Whoohoo. Swing me. Ooh. I like the open gates. We are never closing them again. Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't skate. Come on! You can do it! Look out. Reindeer coming through. I got it, I got it. I don't got it, I don't got it. Hey, guys! That's it, Olaf. Glide and pivot. And glide and pivot. Go. Oh! Anna. Elsa. Bedtime soon. Uhoh. The princess is trapped in the snow goblin's evil spell. Quick, Elsa! Make a prince! A fancy one! Oh, no! The prince is trapped, too. Who cares about danger when there's love? Ugh, Anna. Bleugh! Kissing won't save the Forest. The lost fairies cry out. What sound does a giraffe make? Never mind. They wake the fairy queen. who breaks the spell and saves everyone! And they all get married! What are you playing? Enchanted Forest. The prince and the princess. Hmm. That's like no enchanted forest I've ever seen. You've seen an enchanted forest? Wait, what? I have. Once. And you've never told us this before? Well, I could tell you now, if you. Okay. Now. Tell us now. Are you sure about this? It's time they know. Let's make a big snowman later. If they can settle and listen. Far away. as north as we can go. stood a very old and very enchanted forest. But its magic wasn't that of goblin spells and lost fairies. It was protected by the most powerful spirits of all. those of air. of fire. of water. and earth. But it was also home to the mysterious Northuldra people. Were the Northuldra magical, like me? No, Elsa. They were not magical. They just took advantage of the Forest's gifts. Their ways were so different from ours. but still, they promised us friendship. In honor of that, your grandfather, King Runeard, built them a mighty dam. to strengthen their waters. It was a gift of peace. That's a big gift of peace. And I was so honored to get to go to the Forest to celebrate it. Stand tall, Agnarr. I wasn't at all prepared for what the day would bring. We let down our guard. We were charmed. Whoa. Whoa! It felt so. magical. But something went wrong. They were attacking us. Get behind me. It was a brutal battle. Your grandfather. Father! was lost. Aah! The fighting enraged the spirits. Look out! They turned their magic against us all. There was this voice. and someone saved me. I'm told the spirits then vanished. And a powerful mist covered the Forest. Locking everyone out. And that night, I came home King of Arendelle. Whoa, Papa, that was epic. Whoever saved you, I love them. I wish I knew who it was. What happened to the spirits? What's in the Forest now? I don't know. The mist still stands. No one can get in. And no one has since come out. So we're safe. Yes. But the Forest could wake again. And we must be prepared for whatever danger it may bring. And on that note, how about we say good night to your father? But I still have so many questions. Save them for another night, Anna. You know I don't have that kind of patience. Why did Northuldra attack us anyway? Who attacks people who give them gifts? Do you think the Forest will wake again? Only Ahtohallan knows. Octawhowhat? When I was little. my mother would sing a song about a special river called Ahtohallan. that was said to hold all the answers about the past. About what we are a part of. Wow. Will you sing it for us? Please? Okay. Cuddle close. Scooch in. Where the Northwind Meets the sea There's a river Full of memory Sleep, my darling, safe and sound For in this river, all is found In her waters Deep and true Lie the answers And a path for you Dive down deep into her sound But not too far or you'll be drowned Yes, she will sing to those who hear And in her song, all magic flows But can you brave what you most fear? Can you face what the river knows? Where the Northwind Meets the sea There's a mother Full of memory Come, my darling, homeward bound When all is lost Then all is found Your Majesty. Oh! They're ready. Excuse me. I'm coming. Do you hear that? What? Never mind. Enjoying your new permafrost, Olaf? I'm just living the dream, Anna. How I wish this could last forever. Mmm. And yet, change mocks us with her beauty. What's that? Forgive me. Maturity is making me poetic. Tell me, you're older and thus allknowing. do you ever worry about the notion that. nothing is permanent? Uh. No. Really? Wow, I can't wait until I'm ancient like you. so I don't have to worry about important things. That's not what I mean. I don't worry because. well, I have you and Elsa and Kristoff and Sven. and the gates are open wide. and I'm not alone anymore. Yes, the wind blows a little bit colder And we're all getting older And the clouds are moving on With every autumn breeze Peter Pumpkin just became fertilizer And my leaf's a little sadder and wiser That's why I rely on certain certainties Yes, some things never change Like the feel of your hand in mine Some things stay the same Like how we get along just fine Like an old stone wall that'll never fall Some things are always true! Some things never change Like how I'm holding on tight to you The leaves are already falling Sven, it feels like the future is calling Are you telling me tonight You're gonna get down on one knee? Yeah, but I'm really bad at planning these things out Like candlelight and pulling of rings out Maybe you should leave all the romantic stuff to me! Yeah, some things never change Like the love that I feel for her Some things stay the same Like how reindeers are easier But if I commit and I go for it I'll know what to say and do! Right? Some things never change Sven, the pressure is all on you The winds are restless Could that be why I'm hearing this call? Is something coming? I'm not sure I want things to change at all These days are precious Can't let them slip away I can't freeze this moment But I can still go out and seize this day! Oh! The wind blows a little bit colder And you all look a little bit older It's time to count our blessings Beneath an autumn sky We'll always live in a kingdom of plenty That stands for the good of the many! And I promise you the flag of Arendelle will always fly! Our flag will always fly! Our flag will always fly Our flag will always fly Some things never change Turn around and the time has flown Some things stay the same Though the future remains unknown May our good luck last May our past be past Time's moving fast, it's true Some things never change And I'm holding on tight to you Holding on tight to you Holding on tight to you Holding on tight to you I'm holding on tight to you Uh, okay. Um, lion? Grizzly bear? Uh, monster? Brown bear? Angry face? Black bear? Uh. Hans? Unredeemable monster? Greatest mistake of your life? Wouldn't even kiss you? Villain! Oh! We all kind of got it. Okay, Olaf, you're up. Okay. So much easier now that I can read. Mm. Lightning round, boys against girls. Okay, I'm ready, I'm ready. Go. Unicorn. Ice cream! Castle! Oaken! Teapot! Mouse! Oh! Elsa! I don't think Olaf should get to rearrange. Doesn't matter. This is gonna be a cinch. Two sisters, one mind. Thank you. Okay. Here we go. You got this, Elsa. Hmm. Anytime. Just do it with your body. Uh, nothing? Air? Tree? People? Treeple? Oh, that's not a word. Oh, shovel boy? Teeth? Oh! Doing the dishes? Polar bear? Hey. Sorry. Uh. Ugh. You gotta give me something. Um. Oh! Uh, alarmed? Distracted? Um, worried? Panicking? Disturbed? Oh, come on, you definitely look disturbed. We won. Rematch? Oh, you know what? I think I'll turn in. Are you okay? Just. Just tired. Good night. Yeah, I'm tired, too. And Sven promised to read me a bedtime story. Didn't you, Sven? Did I? Oh, you do the best voices! Like when you pretend to be Kristoff, and you're like. I just need to go talk to some rocks about my childhood and stuff. Um, how about you guys start without me? Ugh. Did Elsa seem weird to you? She seemed like Elsa. Hmm. That last word really seemed to throw her. What was it? I don't know. Ahem. No. No. I don't know, but. Ah. Ice? Oh, come on! She couldn't act out ice? I better go check on her. Uh. Thanks, honey. Love you. Hmm? Love you, too. It's fine. Come in. Yep. Something's wrong. With you? No, with you. You're wearing Mother's scarf. You do that when something's wrong. Did we hurt your feelings? I'm so sorry if we did. You know, very few people are actually good at family games. That's just a fact. No, that's not it. Then, what is it? There's this. I just don't wanna mess things up. What things? You're doing great. Oh, Elsa, when are you going to see yourself the way I see you? What would I do without you? You'll always have me. I know what you need. Come on, come here. What? In Mama's words, cuddle close, scooch in. Mmhmm. Where the Northwind Meets the sea There's a river Full of memory I know what you're doing. Sleep, my darling, safe and sound For in this river, all is found I can hear you But I won't Some look for trouble While others don't There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day And ignore your whispers Which I wish would go away, oh Oh You're not a voice You're just a ringing in my ear And if I heard you Which I don't I'm spoken for, I fear Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls I'm sorry, Secret Siren But I'm blocking out your calls I've had my adventure I don't need something new I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you Into the unknown Into the unknown Into the unknown What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake Are you here to distract me So I make a big mistake? Or are you someone out there Who's a little bit like me Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be? Every day's a little harder As I feel my power grow Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go Into the unknown? Into the unknown! Into the unknown! Whoaohoh Are you out there? Do you know me? Can you feel me? Can you show me? Where are you going? Don't leave me alone How do I follow you Into the unknown? Air, fire, water, earth. The water! The air rages, no fire, no water. The earth is next. We have to get out. It'll be okay. Evacuate to the cliffs. Oh, no! I'm gonna blow! I've got you! Yes. Everyone's out and safe. Here. Take one of these. Huh? You okay there, Olaf? Oh, yeah. We're calling this. controlling what you can when things feel out of control. Okay, I don't understand. You've been hearing a voice and you didn't think to tell me? I didn't want to worry you. We made a promise not to shut each other out. Just tell me what's going on. I woke the magical spirits at the Enchanted Forest. Okay, that's definitely not what I thought you were gonna say. Wait. The Enchanted Forest? The one Father warned us about? Yes. Why would you do that? Because of the voice. I know it sounds crazy. but I believe whoever is calling me is good. How can you say that? Look at our kingdom. I know. It's just that my magic can feel it. I can feel it. Okay. Oh, no. What now? The Trolls? Kristoff! We missed you! Oh! Pabbie. Well, never a dull moment with you two. I hope you're prepared for what you have done, Elsa. Angry magical spirits are not for the faint of heart. Why are they still angry? What does all of this have to do with Arendelle? Let me see what I can see. The past is not what it seems. A wrong demands to be righted. Arendelle is not safe. The truth must be found. Without it. I see no future. No future? When one can see no future. all one can do is the next right thing. The next right thing is for me to go to the Enchanted Forest. and find that voice. Kristoff, can I borrow your wagon and Sven? Hmm? I'm not very comfortable with the idea of that. You are not going alone. Anna, no. I have my powers to protect me. You don't. Excuse me, I climbed the North Mountain. survived a frozen heart, and saved you from my exboyfriend. and I did it all without powers, so, you know, I'm coming. Me, too. I'll drive. I'll bring the snacks! I will look after your people. Please make sure they stay out of the kingdom until we return. Of course. Let's let them know. Anna, I am worried for her. We have always feared Elsa's powers were too much for this world. Now, we must pray they are enough. I won't let anything happen to her. Hyah! Who's into trivia? I am. Okay. Did you know that water has memory? True fact. It's disputed by many, but it's true. Did you know men are six times more likely to be struck by lightning? Did you know gorillas burp when they're happy? Did you know we blink four million times a day? Did you know wombats poop squares? Did you know sleeping quietly on long journeys prevents insanity? Yeah, that's not true. It is. It's true. Definitely true. No, it's the truth. Well, that was unanimous. But I will look it up when we get home. They're both asleep. So, what do you wanna do? Sven, keep us steady, will ya? Hmm. Anna. Ahem. Anna? Mmhmm? Remember our first trip like this. when I said you'd have to be crazy to want to marry a man you just met? Wait, what? Crazy? You didn't say I was crazy. You think I'm crazy? No. I did. You were. Huh? not crazy. Clearly. Just naive. Not naive. Just, uh, new to love. Like I was. And when you're new, you're bound to get it wrong. So you're saying I'm wrong for you. What? No, no. I'm not saying you're wrong, or crazy. Kristoff, stop. Please. Good idea. I hear it. I hear the voice. You do? Olaf, wake up. Whoa. Wow. Whoa! What the. Whoa. Promise me, we do this together, okay? I promise. It's okay. Did you know that an enchanted forest is a place of transformation? I have no idea what that means. but I can't wait to see what it's gonna do to each one of us. Hey! What is this? No pushing. Stop it. Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's too fast. What was that? No. No, no, no. And we're locked in. Probably should have seen that one coming. This forest is beautiful. Ooh. The dam. It still stands. It was in Grand Pabbie's visions. But why? I don't know, but it's still in good shape. Thank goodness. What do you mean? Well, if that dam broke. it would send a tidal wave so big it would wash away everything on this fjord. Everything? But Arendelle's on this fjord. Nothing's gonna happen to Arendelle, Anna. It's gonna be fine. Come here. You know, under different circumstances, this would be a, uh, pretty romantic place. Don't you think? Different circumstances? You mean, like with someone else? What? No! No. I'm saying. Just in case we don't make it out of here. Wait, what? You don't think we're gonna make it out of here? No. No! I mean, no, we will make it out of here. Well, technically the odds are kind of complicated, but my point is. In case we die. You think we're gonna die? No! No, no, no. Where's Elsa? We will die at some point. I swore that I wouldn't leave her side. Not in any recent time will we die. Elsa! But way far in the future, we will die. Don't patronize me. Elsa! There you are. You okay? I'm fine. Okay, good. Where's Olaf? Um. Anna? Elsa? Sven? Samantha? I don't even know a Samantha. Whoa! Mm. That's normal. What was that? Samantha? This will all make sense when I am older Someday I will see that this makes sense One day when I'm old and wise I'll think back and realize That these were all completely normal events! I'll have all the answers when I'm older Like why we're in this dark enchanted wood I know in a couple years These will seem like childish fears And so I know this isn't bad, it's good Excuse me Growing up means adapting Puzzling out your world and your place When I'm more mature I'll feel totally secure Being watched by something with a creepy, creepy face See, that will all make sense when I am older So there's no need to be terrified or tense I'll just dream about a time When I'm in my aged prime 'Cause when you're older Absolutely everything makes sense! This is fine. Whoa! Olaf! Hey, guys. Meet the Wind Spirit. Coming through! Ooh, I think I'm gonna be sick. I'd hold your hair back, but I can't find my arms. Hey! Stop! Elsa! Let her go! Anna, be careful! That's my sister! Prince Agnarr! For Arendelle. Look out! Father! Are you okay? I'm fine. What are these? Oh, they look like moments in time. What's that thing you say, Olaf? The thing. Oh! My theory about advancing technologies as both our savior and our doom? No, not that one. The one about. The one about cucumbers? No. The thing about water. Oh! Yeah. Water has memory. The water that makes up you and me has passed through at least four humans. and/or animals before us. Hmm. And remembers everything. The wind's back. Delicious. I think I'll name you Gale. Get out of there. Whoa! Oh. Hi. Aren't you curious? You in a better mood now? Father. That's Father. This girl. She's saving him. She's Northuldra. What is that? Olaf, get behind me. What are you gonna do with that? I have no idea. Lower your weapon. And you lower yours. Arendellian soldiers? Threatening my people, Lieutenant? Invading my dance space, Yelena? Why does that soldier look so familiar? No, no, no. Lieutenant! Get the sword! That was magic. Did you see that? Of course I saw it. You chose a nice, cold greeting. They've been trapped in here this whole time? Yeah. What do we do now? I got this. Hi, I'm Olaf. Oh, sorry. Yeah, I just find clothes restricting. Bet you're wondering who we are and why we're here. It's really quite simple. It began with two sisters. One born with magical powers. One born powerless. Their love of snowmen, infinite. Anna, no! Too high! Blast! Mama! Papa! Help! Slam! Doors shutting everywhere. Sisters torn apart. Well, at least they have their parents. Their parents are dead. Oh. Oh, hi. I'm Anna. I'll marry a man I just met. Elsa's gonna blow! Snow! Snow! Aah, run! Magic pulses through my snowflakes. I live. Ice palace for one. Ice palace for one. Get out, Anna. Pew! Pew! My heart. Oh, my goodness. Only an act of true love can save you. Here's a true love's kiss. You're not worth it. Guess what? I'm the bad guy. What? And Anna freezes to death forever. Oh, Anna. Then she unfreezes! Oh, and then Elsa woke up the magical spirits. and we were forced out of our kingdom. Now our only hope is to find the truth about the past. but we don't have a clue how to do that. except Elsa's hearing voices, so we got that going for us. Any questions? I think they got it. Are you really Queen of Arendelle? I am. Why would nature reward a person of Arendelle with magic? Perhaps to make up for the actions of your people. My people are innocent. We would have never attacked first. May the truth be found. Mm. Hi. I'm sorry. Uh, what's happening? Hmm. That's it. Lieutenant Mattias! Library, second portrait on the left. You were our father's official guard. Agnarr. What did happen to your parents? Our parents' ship went down in the Southern Sea. six years ago. I see him. I see him in your faces. Really? Soldiers. We may be getting on in years, but we're still strong. And proud to serve Arendelle. Wait. Please. Someone has called me here. If I can just find them. I believe they have the answers that may help us free this forest. Trust me, I just want to help. We only trust nature. When nature speaks. we listen. This will all make sense when I'm older. Fire Spirit! Get back, everyone! Head for the river! No! No! No! The reindeer! That's a dead end! Come on, Sven! We'll get them. Elsa! Get out of there! No, no, no. Elsa! Come on, buddy, we can do this. Hyah! Anna! Oh! Get her out of here. No! Elsa! They're all looking at us, aren't they? Got any advice? Nothing? Hmm. Should I know what that means? You hear it, too. Somebody's calling us. Who is it? What do we do? Okay, keep going north. Elsa! Oh, thank goodness! Anna. Are you okay? What were you doing? You could've been killed. You can't just follow me into fire. You don't want me to follow you into fire, then don't run into fire. You're not being careful, Elsa. I'm sorry. Are you okay? I've been better. Hmm. I know what you need. Where did you get that scarf? That's a Northuldra scarf. What? This is from one of our oldest families. It was our mother's. Elsa. I see it. It's Mother. Mother saved Father's life that day. Our mother was Northuldra. We are called Northuldra. We are the people of the sun. I promise you I will free this forest. and restore Arendelle. That's a pretty big promise, Elsa. Free the Forest? Wow. I'm sorry. It's just, uh, some of us were born in here, we've never even seen a clear sky. I get it. The name's Ryder. Kristoff. I heard the voice again. We need to go north. But the Earth Giants now roam the north at night. You can leave in the morning. I'm Honeymaren. Honeymaren, we'll do all we can. Hey, let me ask you. How do you guys cope. with the everincreasing complexity of thought that comes with maturity? Brilliant! Oh! It's so refreshing to talk to the youth of today. Our future's in bright hands. Oh, no, no. Don't chew that. You don't know what I've stepped in. I can't seem to get her attention. Or even say the right thing. Well, you're in luck. I know nothing about women. But I do know that we have the most amazing way of proposing. If we start now, we'll be ready by dawn. Really? Best part, it involves a lot of reindeer. Whoa. Hey, back at home. Halima still over at Hudson's Hearth? She is. Really? She married? Mmmm. Oh, wow. Why didn't that make me feel better? What else do you miss? My father. He passed long before all this. He was a great man. Built us a good life in Arendelle. But taught me to never take the good for granted. He'd say, Be prepared. Just when you think you've found your way, life will throw you onto a new path. What do you do when it does? Don't give up. Take it one step at a time and. Just do the next right thing? Yeah. You got it. I wanna show you something. May I? You know air, fire, water, and earth. Yes. But, look, there's a fifth spirit. said to be a bridge between us and the magic of nature. A fifth spirit? Some say they heard it call out the day the Forest fell. My father heard it. Do you think that is who's calling me? Maybe. Alas, only Ahtohallan knows. Ahtohallan. Dive down deep into her sound But not too far or you'll be drowned Why do lullabies always have to have some terrible warning in them? I wonder that all the time. Earth Giants. What are they doing down here? Shh! Hide. They're coming! This is why we don't play with fire. Oh, I can't stay mad at you. Why are you so cute? Please tell me you were not about to follow them. What if I can settle them like I did the wind and fire? Or what if they can crush you before you even get the chance? Remember, the goal is to find the voice. find the truth, and get us home. Hey, guys. That was close. I know. The giants sensed me. They may come back here. I don't want to put anyone at risk again. And you're right, Anna. We've got to find the voice. We're going now. Okay. We're going. Let me just. Wait. Where are Kristoff and Sven? Oh, yeah. I think they took off with that Ryder guy and a bunch of reindeer. They left? Mmhmm. Just left without saying anything? Who knows the ways of men? Am I supposed to feel this ridiculous? Oh, yeah. Definitely. Everyone ready? Ready! Uh, I could use a rehearsal. I love love. Wait. You talk for them, too? I do. It's like you can actually hear what they're thinking. Yeah. And then you just say it. And then you just say it. Okay. Here she comes. Princess Anna of Arendelle. my feisty, fearless, gingersweet love. Will you marry me? Um. No. The princess left with the queen. What? Wait, what? What? I wouldn't try to follow. They're long gone. Long gone? So, yeah. Um, we're heading west to the Lichen Meadows. You can come with us if you want. Hey. Um. I'm really sorry that. No, it's fine. Yeah. Yep. Okay, I better go pack. You coming with? I'll just. Yeah, I'll meet you there. Okay, uh, you know where you're going, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yep. I know the woods. Reindeers are better than people Sven, why is love so hard? You feel what you feel And those feelings are real Come on, Kristoff Let down your guard Again, you're gone Off on a diff'rent path than mine I'm left behind Wondering if I should follow You had to go And, of course, it's always fine I prob'ly could catch up with you tomorrow But is this what it feels like to be growing apart? When did I become the one Who's always chasing your heart? Now I turn around and find I am lost in the woods North is South Right is left When you're gone I'm the one who sees you home But now I'm lost in the woods And I don't know what path you are on I'm lost in the woods Up till now The next step was a question of how I never thought it was a question of whether Who am I If I'm not your guy? Where am I if we're not together? Forever Now I know you're my true North 'Cause I am lost in the woods Up is down Day is night When you're not there Oh, you're my only landmark So I'm lost in the woods Wondering if you still care But I'll wait For a sign For a sign That I'm your path 'Cause you are mine You are mine Until then I'm lost in the woods Lost in the woods In the woods Lost in the woods I'm lost in the woods Lost in the woods I'm lost I'm lost in the woods Hey, Olaf, um, maybe just one of you should do it. I agree. She's a little pitchy. Hey, Gale's back. What? How can it be? What is it? Mother and Father's ship. But this isn't the Southern Sea. No, it isn't. Why is their ship here? How is it here? It must have been washed in from the Dark Sea. What were they doing in the Dark Sea? I don't know. How did the ship get through the mist? I thought nobody could but us. Unless nobody was on it. There's gotta be something here. Wait. Wait. Look around. Every Arendellian ship has a compartment. Waterproof. That's very clever. Although, it does make me wonder why they don't just make the whole ship waterproof. Here. What language is this? I don't know. But look, this is Mother's handwriting. The end of the ice age. The river found, but lost. Magic's source. Elsa's source? It's a map. They traveled north and planned to cross the Dark Sea to. Ahtohallan. It's real? Octawhowhat? Ahtohallan. It's a magical river said to hold all the answers about the past. Reinforcing my water has memory theory. Mm. Water has memory. Elsa? I wanna know what happened to them. Ahtohallan has to be the source of her magic. We keep going for Elsa. The waves are too high! Iduna! Agnarr! Elsa! Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? This is my fault. They were looking for answers about me. You are not responsible for their choices, Elsa. No. Just their deaths. Stop. No. Yelena asked, why would the spirits reward Arendelle with a magical queen? Because our mother saved our father. She saved her enemy. Her good deed was rewarded with you. You are a gift. For what? If anyone can resolve the past. if anyone can save Arendelle and free this forest, it's you. I believe in you, Elsa. More than anyone or anything. Honeymaren said there was a fifth spirit. A bridge between the magic of nature and us. A fifth spirit? That's who's been calling me from Ahtohallan. The answers about the past are all there. So we go to Ahtohallan. Not we. Me. What? The Dark Sea is too dangerous for us both. No. No! We do this together. Remember the song? Go too far and you'll be drowned. Who will stop you from going too far? You said you believed in me, that this is what I was born to do. And I don't wanna stop you from that. I. I don't wanna stop you from being whatever you need to be. I just don't want you dying. trying to be everything for everyone else, too. Don't do this alone. Let me help you, please. I can't lose you, Elsa. I can't lose you either, Anna. Come on. Mmm. Wait, what? What are you doing? Elsa! No! No! Olaf, help me stop. Give me a hand. Hang on! Whoa! Wait. Wait! No! No! No! Oh, come on! Anna, this might sound crazy. but I'm sensing some rising anger. Well, I am angry, Olaf! She promised me we'd do this together! Yeah. Uhhuh. But what I mean is, I'm sensing rising anger in me. Wait, you're angry? Um, I. I think so. Elsa pushed me away, too, and didn't even say goodbye. And you have every right to be very, very mad at her. And you said some things never change. But since then, everything's done nothing but change. I know. But look, I'm still here holding your hand. Yeah, that's a good point, Anna. I feel better. You're such a good listener. Don't shush me. That's rude. No! No! Oh. The Giants. They're huge. Hang on, Olaf. Huh? Try not to scream. Found it. Thank you. Where are we? In a pit with no way out. But with a spooky, pitchblack way in. Come on, it'll be fun. Assuming we don't get stuck here forever, no one ever finds us. and you starve and I give up. But, bright side, Elsa's gotta be doing a whole lot better than we are. Okay. Oh. Whoa! No! Whoa! No! Of course. Glaciers are rivers of ice. Ahtohallan is frozen. I hear you. And I'm coming. Every inch of me is trembling But not from the cold Something is familiar Like a dream I can reach but not quite hold I can sense you there Like a friend I've always known I'm arriving And it feels like I am home I have always been a fortress Cold secrets deep inside You have secrets, too But you don't have to hide Show yourself I'm dying to meet you Show yourself It's your turn Are you the one I've been looking for all of my life? Show yourself I'm ready to learn I've never felt so certain All my life I've been torn But I'm here for a reason Could it be the reason I was born? I have always been so different Normal rules did not apply Is this the day? Are you the way I finally find out why? Show yourself! I'm no longer trembling Here I am I've come so far You are the answer I've waited for All of my life Oh, show yourself! Let me see who you are Come to me now Open your door Don't make me wait One moment more Oh, come to me now Open your door Don't make me wait One moment more Where the Northwind Meets the sea There's a river Full of memory Mother. Come, my darling, homeward bound I am found! Show yourself Step into your power Grow yourself Into something new You are the one you've been waiting for All of my life Oh, show yourself! Hi, I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs. I love you, Olaf! Come on, you can do it. Here I stand Oh. In the light of day Oh! Like a chicken with the face of a monkey! I just wasn't looking where I was going. But I'm great actually. Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. I love you. I need to tell you about my past. And where I'm from. I'm listening. Iduna! What are you reading, Your Majesty? Oh, some new Danish author. King Runeard, I'm sorry. I don't understand. Grandfather? We bring Arendelle's full guard. But they have given us no reason not to trust them. The Northuldra follow magic. Which means we can never trust them. Grandfather? Magic makes people feel too powerful. Too entitled. It makes them think they can defy the will of a king. That is not what magic does. That's just your fear. Fear is what can't be trusted. You see, the dam will weaken their lands, so they will have to turn to me. Dive down deep into her sound But not too far, or you'll be drowned They will come in celebration. And then, we will know their size and strength. As you have welcomed us, we welcome you. our neighbors, our friends. King Runeard, the dam isn't strengthening our waters. It's hurting the Forest. It's cutting off the North. Let. Let's not discuss this here. Let's meet on the fjord. Have tea. Find a solution. No! Anna! Hmm. Which lucky tunnel do we choose? You see, the dam will weaken their lands, so they will have to turn to me. King Runeard, the dam, it's hurting the Forest. Elsa's found it. What is it? The truth about the past. That's my grandfather. attacking the Northuldra leader. who wields no weapon. The dam wasn't a gift of peace. It was a trick. But that goes against everything Arendelle stands for. It does, doesn't it? I know how to free the Forest. I know what we have to do to set things right. Why do you say that so sadly? We have to break the dam. But Arendelle will be flooded. That's why everyone was forced out. To protect them from what has to be done. Oh. Oh! Are you okay? I could really use a bright side, Olaf. Bright side? Um. Turtles can breathe through their butts. Huh? And I see a way out. I knew I could count on you. Come on, Olaf, Elsa's probably on her way back right now. We can meet her and. Olaf? What's this? Are you okay? I'm flurrying? Wait. No. That's. That's not it. I'm flurrying away. The magic in me is fading. What? I don't think Elsa's okay. I think. she may have gone too far. No. No. Anna? I'm sorry. You're gonna have to do this next part on your own. Okay? Wait. Come here. I've got you. Oh. That's good. Hey, Anna? I just thought of one thing that's permanent. What's that? Love. Warm hugs? I like warm hugs. I love you. Olaf? Elsa? What do I do now? I've seen dark before But not like this This is cold This is empty This is numb The life I knew is over The lights are out Hello, darkness I'm ready to succumb I follow you around I always have But you've gone to a place I cannot find This grief has a gravity It pulls me down But a tiny voice Whispers in my mind You are lost Hope is gone But you must go on And do the next right thing Can there be a day beyond this night? I don't know anymore what is true I can't find my direction I'm all alone The only star that guided me was you How to rise from the floor When it's not you I'm rising for? Just do the next right thing Take a step Step again It is all that I can To do the next right thing I won't look too far ahead It's too much for me to take But break it down to this next breath This next step This next choice is one that I can make! So I'll walk through this night Stumbling blindly toward the light And do the next right thing And with the dawn What comes then? When it's clear that everything Will never be the same again? Then I'll make the choice To hear that voice And do The next right thing Wake up! Wake up! That's it. Come and get me! Come on! Over here! That's right. Keep coming. Keep coming! That'll work. This way, guys! What? No, no, no, no. She's leading them to the dam. Kristoff! I'm here. What do you need? To get to the dam. You got it. Thank you. Come on. Come on. Help me up! We'll meet you around! Lieutenant Mattias. Your Highness, what are you doing? The dam must fall. It's the only way to break the mist and free the Forest. But we've sworn to protect Arendelle at all costs. Arendelle has no future until we make this right. King Runeard betrayed everyone. How do you know that? My sister gave her life for the truth. Please. Before we lose anyone else. Look out! Destroy the dam! Come on! Throw your boulders. That's it. I've got her! Anna! Hang on! I'm sorry I left you behind. I was just so desperate to protect her. I know. I know. It's okay. My love is not fragile. Wow. Look at the sky. I just didn't realize there was so much of it. 34 years. Five months. And 23 days. Is it really you? Anna. I thought I'd lost you. Lost me? You saved me. Again. I did? And, Anna, Arendelle did not fall. It didn't? The spirits all agreed. Arendelle deserves to stand with you. Me? You did what was right. For everyone. Did you find the fifth spirit? You are the fifth spirit. You're the bridge. Well, actually, a bridge has two sides. And Mother had two daughters. We did this together. And we'll continue to do this together. Together. Elsa! You're okay! You look different. Did you cut your hair or something? Or something. Oh. Anna, I need to ask you a question. Okay. Do you want to build a snowman? What? Thank goodness water has memory. Anna. Elsa! Kristoff! And Sven! You all came back. Oh, I love happy endings. I mean, I presume we're done. Or is this putting us in mortal danger situation gonna be a regular thing? No. We're done. Actually, there is one more thing. Anna, you are the most extraordinary person I've ever known. I love you with all I am. Will you marry me? Oh. Yes! Ah. Aw. Arendelle's okay. What? Ahtohallan is beautiful. Oh! Hello. You know, you belong up here. I took an oath to always do what's best for Arendelle. Luckily, I know just what that is. While I still don't know what transformation means. I feel like this Forest has really changed us all. Presenting Her Majesty, Queen Anna of Arendelle! Oh! Hello. Hi. Sven, don't you look nice. Oh, my goodness! Olaf! Charmed, I'm sure. Charming. Your Majesty. Kristoff. Aw, did you boys get all dressed up for me? It was Sven's idea. One hour. You get this for one hour. That's okay. I prefer you in leather anyway. I'm shocked you can last an hour. That was brutal. The things we do for love. What is this crazy magic called again? A photograph. Photograph. Huh. We look good. Halima. General Mattias. Uh, Your Majesty. I'll be right back. You can look at our photograph while I'm gone. I'm just kidding. How am I doing? Fantastic. Our lands and people, now connected by love. Hi, Gale. You like it? Oh, do you mind? I've got a message for my sister. Thank you. Charades Friday night. Don't be late. And don't worry, Arendelle's doing just fine. Keep looking after the Forest. I love you. I love you, too, sis. Hey, Gale? We're going for a ride, wanna come? You ready? Ah ah oh oh oh Ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh Into the unknown Into the unknown Into the unknown Ah ah oh oh oh I can hear you but I won't Some look for trouble while others don't There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day And ignore your whispers Which I wish would go away Oh oh oh Whoa oh You're not a voice You're just a ringing in my ear And if I heard you which I don't I'm spoken for I fear Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls I'm sorry, secret siren But I'm blocking out your calls I've had my adventure I don't need something new I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you. Into the unknown Into the unknown Into the unknown Ah ah oh oh oh Ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake? Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me? Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be? Every day's a little harder As I feel your power grow Don't you know there's a part of me That longs to go. Into the unknown Into the unknown Into the unknown Ah ah oh oh oh Ah ah oh oh oh Whoa oh oh Are you out there? Do you know me? Can you feel me? Can you show me? Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Ah ah oh oh Where are you going? Don't leave me alone How do I follow you Into the unknown Whoo! Where the Northwind Meets the sea There's a river Full of memory Sleep, my darling Safe and sound For in this river, all is found All is found When all is lost then all is found In her waters Deep and true Lie the answers and a path for you Dive down deep into her sound But not too far or you'll be drowned She will sing to those who hear And in her song all magic flows But can you brave what you most fear? Can you face what the river knows? Until the river's finally crossed You'll never feel the solid ground You have to get a little lost On your way To being found Where the Northwind Meets the sea There's a mother Full of memory Come, my darling, homeward bound Where all is lost Then all is found All is found All is found Again you're gone Off on a diff'rent path than mine I'm left behind Wondering if I should follow You had to go And, of course, it's always fine I prob'ly could catch up with you tomorrow But is this what it feels like To be growing apart? When did I become the one Who's always chasing your heart? Now I turn around and find I am lost in the woods North is South Right is left When you're gone I'm the one who sees you home But now I'm lost in the woods And I don't know what path you are on I'm lost in the woods Up till now The next step was a question of how I never thought it was a question of whether Who am I If I'm not your guy? Where am I if we're not together? Forever Now I know you're my true North 'Cause I am lost in the woods Up is down Day is night When you're not there Oh, you're my only landmark So I'm lost in the woods Wondering if you still care But I'll wait For a sign For a sign That I'm your path 'Cause you are mine You are mine Until then I'm lost in the woods\u200e Lost in the woods In the woods Lost in the woods I'm lost in the woods Lost in the woods I'm lost I'm lost in the woods Show yourself right now! Elsa, be who you are. Oh, I will, Mama, I will. Elsa's dead. Olaf's dead. Anna cries. And then a bunch of important things happen that I forgot. But all that matters is, I was right. And water has memory, and thus. I live! And so do you. Whoa! We live! We live! Oh! Good story.
