Thirteen meters. You should see it. Okay, take her up and over the bow rail. Okay, Mir2, we're going over the bow. Stay with us. Okay, quiet. We're rolling. Seeing her coming out of the darkness like a ghost ship. still gets me every time. To see the sad ruin of the great ship, sitting here. of April 15, 1912. after her long fall. from the world above. You're so full of shit, boss. Dive 6. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic. 2.5 miles down. 3,821 meters. The pressure outside is 3.5 tons per square inch. These windows are 9 inches thick and if they go. it's sayonara in 2 microseconds. All right, enough of that bullshit. Just put her down on the roof of the officers' quarters like yesterday. Sure. Okay, Mir2, we're landing right over the Grand Staircase. You guys set to launch? Yeah, Brock, launching Dunkin now. Go, Charlie. All right, tether out. Tether out. Okay, Brock, we're dropping down along the hull. Yeah, roger that. Okay, drop down, and go into the firstclass gangway door. I want you guys working the D deck reception area and the dining saloon. Copy that. Tether out. Tether out. Okay, now left. Now left. Left, left. Snoop Dog is on the move. We're headed down the stairwell. Okay, Lewis, drop down to B deck. A deck. Give me some rope, Captain. B deck. Get in there. Watch the door frame. Watch it. I see it. I got it. We're good. Just chill, boss. Okay, make your turn. Cable out, Captain. Make your turn. Watch the wall. Brock, we're at the piano. You copy? Copy that. Right there. That's it. That's the bedroom door. I see it. We're in. We're in, baby. We're there. That's Hockley's bed. That's where the son of a bitch slept. Oops. Somebody left the water running. Hold it. Just a second. Go back to the right. That wardrobe door. Get closer. You're smelling something, boss. I want to see what's under it. Give me my hands, man. All right. Take it easy. It might come apart. Okay. Okay, go. Flip it over. Go. Turn over. Keep going. Go. Okay, drop it. Oh, baby. Are you seeing this, boss? It's payday, boys. Chaching! We did it, Bobby. We brought it back. Oh, yeah! You the man! Who's the best, baby? Say it. You are, Lewis. Bobby, my cigar. Right here. Okay, crack her open. Let me get around. Hang on. You getting it? Got it. Shit. No diamond. You know, boss, this same thing happened to Geraldo. and his career never recovered. Turn the camera off. Brock. The partners would like to know how it's going. Hey, Dave. Barry, hi. Look, it wasn't in the safe. Don't worry about it. There are still plenty of places it could be. Hell, yes. The floor debris in the suite, the mother's room. The purser's safe on C deck. Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase. A dozen other places. Guys, look, you just got to trust my instincts. I know we're close. We just got to go through a little process of elimination. Hang on a second. Let me see that. We might have something here, guys. Where's the photograph of the necklace? We'll call you right back. I'll be goddamned. Treasure hunter Brock Lovett is best known for finding Spanish gold. It's okay, I'll feed you in a minute. He has chartered Russian subs to reach the most famous shipwreck of all. the Titanic. He's with us live via satellite, from the research ship Keldysh. in the North Atlantic. Hello, Brock. Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows the familiar stories of Titanic. You know, the nobility of the band playing to the very end and all that. But what I'm interested in are the untold stories. the secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic. And we're out here using robot technology to go further into the wreck. than anybody has ever done before. Your expedition is at the center of a storm. of controversy over salvage rights, and even ethics. Many are calling you a graverobber. Nobody ever called the recovery of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb. What is it? Turn that up, dear. I have museumtrained experts sent out here making sure. that these relics are preserved and catalogued properly. Take a look at this drawing that we found just today. A piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years. and my team are able to preserve it intact. Should this have remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity? We can see it and. I'll be goddamned. Brock, there's a satellite call for you. Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles going in the water? Trust me, buddy, you want to take this call. This better be good. You got to speak up. She's kind of old. Great. This is Brock Lovett. How can I help you, Mrs.. Calvert. Rose Calvert. Mrs. Calvert? I was just wondering if you had found the Heart of the Ocean yet, Mr. Lovett. Told you you wanted to take the call. All right, you have my attention, Rose. Can you tell us who the woman in the picture is? Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me. She's a goddamn liar! Some nutcase seeking money or publicity. God only knows why! Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia. They're inbound! Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic when she was 17, right? That's right. If she had lived, she'd be over 100 by now. 101 next month. Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar. Look, I've already done the background on this woman. all the way back to the '20s, when she was working as an actress. An actress. There's your first clue, Sherlock. Her name was Rose Dawson back then. Then she marries this guy named Calvert. They move to Cedar Rapids and she punches out a couple of kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead. And everybody who knows about the diamond. is supposed to be dead or on this boat, but she knows. Doesn't exactly travel light, does she? Hurry up, give him a hand! Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett. Welcome to the Keldysh. Okay, let's get her inside there. Hi, Miss Calvert. Hi. Welcome to the Keldysh. Thanks. Yes? Are your staterooms all right? Oh, yes, very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. We met just a few minutes ago. Remember, Nana, up on deck? Oh, yeah. There. That's nice. Have to have my pictures when I travel. Can I get you anything? Is there anything you'd like? Yes. I would like to see my drawing. Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone called the Blue Diamond of the Crown. It disappeared in 1792. About the same time old Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped, too. Recut into a heartlike shape that became known as the Heart of the Ocean. Today, it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond. It was a dreadful, heavy thing. I only wore it this once. You actually think this is you, Nana? It is me, dear. Wasn't I a dish? I tracked it down through insurance records. An old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Can you tell me who the claimant was, Rose? I should imagine someone named Hockley. Nathan Hockley. That's right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. The claim was for a diamond necklace his son, Caledon, bought his fiancee, you. A week before he sailed on Titanic. It was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to have gone down with the ship. You see the date? April 14, 1912. Which means if your grandmother is who she says she is. she was wearing the diamond the day the Titanic sank. And that makes you my new best friend. These are some of the things we recovered from your stateroom. This was mine. How extraordinary! And it looks the same as it did the last time I saw it. The reflection has changed a bit. Are you ready to go back to Titanic? Here we go. She hits the 'berg on the starboard side. She kind of bumps along, punching holes like Morse code along the side. below the water line. Then the forward compartments start to flood. Now, as the water level rises, it spills over the watertight bulkheads. which, unfortunately, don't go any higher than E deck. So now, as the bow goes down, the stern rises up, slow at first. then faster and faster, until finally, she's got her whole ass sticking in the air. And that's a big ass. We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons. Okay? And the hull's not designed to deal with that pressure. So what happens? She splits, right down to the keel. and the stern falls back level. Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the stern vertical and then finally detaches. Now the stern section kind of bobs there like a cork for a couple of minutes. floods, and finally goes under 2 hours and 40 minutes after the collision. The bow section planes away, landing about a.5 a mile away. going 20, 30 knots when it hits the ocean floor. Pretty cool, huh? Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course, the experience of it was somewhat different. Will you share it with us? I'm taking her to rest. No. Come on, Nana. No! Give me the tape recorder. Tell us, Rose. It's been 84 years. It's okay. Just try to remember anything, anything at all. Do you want to hear this or not, Mr. Lovett? It's been 84 years. and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in. Titanic was called The Ship of Dreams. And it was. It really was. All thirdclass passengers with a forward berth. this way, please! This queue! Right here. It's a big boat, huh? Daddy, it's a ship. You're right. I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania. You can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. It's over 100 feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious. Your daughter is far too difficult to impress, Ruth. So this is the ship they say is unsinkable. It is unsinkable. God himself could not sink this ship. Sir, you have to check your baggage through the main terminal. It's round that way, sir. I put my faith in you, good sir. Now, kindly see my man. Yes, sir. It's my pleasure, sir. If I can do anything at all. Yes, right. All the trunks from that car there. 12 from here. And the safe, to the parlor suite, rooms B52, 54, 56. Ladies, we better hurry. Come along. My coat? I have it, miss. Queue here for health inspection. All thirdclass passengers queue here for health inspection. Chin up. Welcome aboard, ma'am. Welcome to Titanic. It was the ship of dreams to everyone else. To me, it was a slave ship. taking me back to America in chains. Outwardly, I was everything a well brought up girl should be. Inside, I was screaming. Jack, you are pazzo. You bet everything we have. When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose. Sven? Bet. All right. Moment of truth. Somebody's life is about to change. Brizio? Niente. Niente. Olaf? Nothing. Sven? 2 pair. I'm sorry, Fabrizio. Che sorry, ma vaffanculo! Did you bet all our money? I'm sorry, you're not going to see your mom again for a long time. 'Cause we're going to America. Full house, boys. Come on. I'm going home! I'm going home. I go to America! No, mate. Titanic go to America, in 5 minutes. Shit, Fabri. Come on. Come on, here. We're riding in high style now. We're a couple of regular swells. We're practically goddamn royalty, ragazzo mio. You see? Is my destino. Like I told you, I go to America to be millionaire. You are pazzo. Maybe, but I've got the tickets. I thought you were fast. Aspetta! Wait! Hey, wait! We're passengers! Passengers! Have you been through the inspection queue? Of course. Anyway, we don't have any lice. We're Americans, both of us. Right. Come aboard. We're the luckiest sons of bitches in the world. You know that? Goodbye! You know somebody? Of course not. That's not the point. Goodbye. I'll miss you. Goodbye! Goodbye. I will never forget you! Come with me, darling. Let's go. G60. Excuse me, ma'am. Right here. How you doing? Jack. Nice to meet you. Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you. How you doing? Who says you get top bunk? This is your private promenade deck, sir. Would you be requiring anything? Excuse me. This one? No. It had a lot of faces on it. This is the one. Would you like all of them out, miss? Yes, we need a little color in this room. Put it in there. In the wardrobe. God, not those fingerpaintings again. They certainly were a waste of money. The difference between Cal's taste in art and mine is that I have some. They're fascinating. like being inside a dream or something. There's truth, but no logic. What's the artist's name? Something Picasso. Something Picasso. He won't amount to a thing. He won't, trust me. Put the Degas in the bedroom. At least they were cheap. Put it in the wardrobe. At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown. We all called her Molly. History would call her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. I wasn't about to wait all day for you, sonny. Here, if you think you can manage. Her husband had struck gold, someplace out west. And she was what mother called New Money. By the next afternoon, we were steaming west. from the coast of Ireland. with nothing out ahead of us but ocean. Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch. Let's stretch her legs. Yes, sir. All ahead full, Mr. Moody. Very good, sir. All ahead full. All ahead full! Come on, lads, step lively. What's the reading? All right! Let's stoke her right up! We go full ahead! Come on, right back to work. 21 knots, sir. Hey, look! See it? There's another one. See him? Look at that one! Look at him jump! I can see the Statue of Liberty already. Very small, of course. I'm the king of the world! She's the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man in all history. And our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews, here, designed her from the keel plates up. I may have knocked her together, but the idea was Mr. Ismay's. He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale. and so luxurious in its appointments that its supremacy would never be challenged. And here she is, willed into solid reality. Hear, hear. The salmon. You know I don't like that, Rose. She knows. We'll both have the lamb. Rare, with very little mint sauce. You like lamb, right, sweet pea? Sausage. You gonna cut her meat for her, too, there, Cal? Hey, who thought of the name Titanic? Was it you, Bruce? Yes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size. And size means stability, luxury. and above all, strength. Do you know of Dr. Freud, Mr. Ismay? His ideas about the male preoccupation with size. might be of particular interest to you. What's gotten into you? Excuse me. I do apologize. She's a pistol, Cal. Hope you can handle her. I may have to start minding what she reads from now on. won't I, Mrs. Brown? Freud, who is he? Is he a passenger? The ship is nice? Yeah, it's an Irish ship. Is English, no? No, it was built in Ireland. 15,000 Irishmen built this ship. Solid as a rock. Big Irish hands. Well, that's typical. Firstclass dogs come down here to take a shit. Lets us know where we rank in the scheme of things. Like we could forget. I'm Tommy Ryan. Jack Dawson. Hello. Fabrizio. Hi. Do you make any money with your drawings? Forget it, boyo. You'd as like have angels fly out of your arse. as get next to the likes of her. I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it. An endless parade of parties and cotillions. yachts and polo matches. Always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a great precipice. with no one to pull me back. No one who cared. or even noticed. Don't do it. Stay back. Don't come any closer. Come on. Just give me your hand, I'll pull you back over. No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go. No, you won't. What do you mean, no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me. Well, you would have done it already. You're distracting me. Go away. I can't. I'm involved now. You let go, and I'm gonna have to jump in there after you. Don't be absurd. You'll be killed. I'm a good swimmer. The fall alone will kill you. It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To tell you the truth, I'm a lot more concerned. about that water being so cold. How cold? Freezing. Maybe a couple of degrees over. You ever. You ever been to Wisconsin? What? They have some of the coldest winters around. I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. I remember, when I was a kid, me and my father. we went ice fishing out on Lake Wissota. Ice fishing is, you know, where you I know what ice fishing is. Sorry. You just seem like, you know, kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I. I fell through some thin ice. And I'm telling you. water that cold. like right down there. it hits you like a 1,000 knives stabbing you all over your body. You can't breathe. You can't think. Least, not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in there after you. Like I said. I don't have a choice. I guess I'm kind of hoping you'll come back over the rail an. and get me off the hook here. You're crazy. That's what everybody says bu. but with all due respect, miss. I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship here. Come on. Give me your hand. You don't want to do this. I'm Jack Dawson. Rose Dewitt Bukater. I'll have to get you to write that one down. Come on. I got you. Come on. Come on! Help, please! Please, help me! Listen to me. I've got you. I won't let go. Now pull yourself up. Come on! Come on. That's right. You can do it. I got you. What's all this? You stand back! And don't move an inch! Fetch the masteratarms. This is completely unacceptable. What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee? Look at me, you filth! Cal. What do you think you were doing? Cal, stop. It was an accident. An accident? It was. Stupid, really. I was leaning over and I slipped. I was leaning far over to see the. Propellers? Propellers, and I slipped. And I would have gone overboard, but Mr. Dawson here saved me. And almost went over himself. She wanted to see the propellers. Like I said, women and machinery do not mix. Was that the way of it? Yeah, that was pretty much it. Well, the boy's a hero, then. Good for you, son. Well done. So, it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh? Aha. Look at you. You must be freezing. Let's get you inside. Err. perhaps a little something for the boy? Of course. Mr. Lovejoy. I think a 20 should do it. Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love? Rose is displeased. What to do? I know. Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow evening. To regale our group with your heroic tale. Sure. Count me in. Good. It's settled then. This should be interesting. Can I bum a smoke? You'll want to tie those. It's interesting. The young lady slipped so suddenly. and you still had time to remove your jacket and your shoes. I know you've been melancholy. I don't pretend to know why. I intended to save this. until the engagement gala next week. But I thought, tonight. Good gracious! Perhaps as a reminder of my feelings for you. Is it a Diamond? Yes. 56 carats to be exact. It was worn by Louis XVI. And they called it Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. The Heart of the Ocean. Yes. It's overwhelming. It's for royalty. We are royalty, Rose. You know, there is nothing I couldn't give you. There is nothing I'd deny you. if you would not deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose. I've been on my own since I was 15. Since my folks died. And I had no brothers or sisters or close kin in that part of the country. So I lit on out of there and I haven't been back since. You can just call me a tumbleweed blowing in the wind. Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile around this boat deck. chewed over how great the weather's been and how I grew up. but I reckon that's not why you came to talk to me, is it? Mr. Dawson, I Jack. Jack. I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for pulling me back. but for your discretion. You're welcome. Look. Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery? No. That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was. what could have happened to this girl to make her think she had no way out? Well, I. It was everything. It was my whole world and all the people in it. And the inertia of my life. plunging ahead, and me, powerless to stop it. God, look at that thing. You'd have gone straight to the bottom. 500 invitations have gone out. All of Philadelphia society will be there. And all the while, I feel I'm . standing in the middle of a crowded room. screaming at the top of my lungs, and no one even looks up. Do you love him? Pardon me? Do you love him? You're being very rude. You shouldn't be asking me this. It's a simple question. Do you love the guy or not? This is not a suitable conversation. Why can't you just answer the question? This is absurd. You don't know me and I don't know you. and we are not having this conversation at all. You are rude and uncouth and presumptuous and. I am leaving now. Jack, Mr. Dawson, it's been a pleasure. I sought you out to thank you and now I have thanked you And you've insulted me. Well, you deserved it. Right. Right. I thought you were leaving. I am. You are so annoying. Wait, I don't have to leave. This is my part of the ship. You leave. Well, well, well! Now who's being rude? What is this stupid thing you're carrying around? So, what are you, an artist or something? These are rather good. They're they're very good, actually. Jack, this is exquisite work. They didn't think too much of them in old Paree. Paris? You do get around for a. Well, a person of limited means. Go on, a poor guy. You can say it. Well, well, well. And these were drawn from life? That's one of the good things about Paris. Lots of girls willing to take their clothes off. You liked this woman. You used her several times. Well, she had beautiful hands, you see? I think you must have had a love affair with her. No, no, no, no just with her hands. She was a onelegged prostitute. See? She had a good sense of humor, though. And this lady. she used to sit at this bar every night. wearing every piece of jewelry she owned just. waiting for her long lost love. We called her Madame Bijoux. See, her clothes are all motheaten. Well, you have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. I see you. And? You wouldn't have jumped. But the purpose of university is to find a suitable husband. Rose has already done that. Look, here comes that vulgar Brown woman. Quickly, get up before she sits with us. Hello, girls. I was hoping I'd catch you at tea. We're awfully sorry. You missed it. The Countess and I were just off to take the air on the boat deck. What a lovely idea. I need to catch up on my gossip. Countess. You've not yet lit the last 4 boilers? No, I don't see the need. We are making excellent time. The press knows the size of Titanic. Now, I want them to marvel at her speed. We must give them something new to print. This maiden voyage of Titanic must make headlines. Mr. Ismay. I would prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in. Of course, I'm just a passenger. I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best. But what a glorious end to your final crossing. if we were to get into New York on Tuesday night and surprise them all. Make the morning papers. Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.? Good man. Well, after that, I worked on a squid boat in Monterey, then I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. and started doing portraits there for 10 cents a piece. Why can't I be like you, Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there sometime, to that pier. even if we only ever just talk about it. No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer, we'll ride on the roller coaster till we throw up. Then we'll ride horses on the beach, right in the surf. But you'll have to do it like a real cowboy, none of that sidesaddle stuff. You mean, one leg on each side? Yeah. Can you show me? Sure, if you like. Teach me to ride like a man. And chew tobacco like a man. And spit like a man. What, they didn't teach you that in finishing school? No. Come on, I'll show you. Let's do it. I'll show you how, come on. Jack, no. Come on. No. Wait, Jack. Come on. No, Jack. I couldn't possibly, Jack. Watch closely. That's disgusting. All right, your turn. That was pitiful. Come on, you really gotta hawk it back. Get some leverage to it, use your arms. arc your neck. You see the range on that thing? Okay, go. That was better. You got to work on it. Really? Really try to hawk it up and get some body to it. You gotta. Mother. May I introduce Jack Dawson? Charmed, I'm sure. The others were gracious and curious. about the man who'd saved my life. But my mother looked at him like an insect. A dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly. Jack, sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky spot. Why do they always insist on announcing dinner. like a damn cavalry charge? Shall we go dress, Mother? See you at dinner, Jack. Son? Son! Do you have the slightest comprehension of what you're doing? Not really. You're about to go into the snake pit. What are you planning to wear? I figured. Come on. I was right. You and my son are just about the same size. Pretty close. You shine up like a new penny. Good evening, sir. There are several thousand tons of Hockley steel in this very ship. Which part? All the right ones, of course. Then we'll know who to hold accountable if there's a problem. Where's my daughter? She'll be along. There is the Countess. Hello, my dear. Good evening, Cal. So good to see you. I saw that in a nickelodeon once and I always wanted to do it. I'll see you at dinner. Darling. surely you remember Mr. Dawson. Dawson. That's amazing. You could almost pass for a gentleman. Almost. Extraordinary. My dear, it's delightful to see you. What a remarkable voyage this is. It's mad, isn't it? Completely lunatic. There's the Countess of Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor. the richest man on the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age, and in a delicate condition. See how she's trying to hide it? Quite the scandal. And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course. And over here, we have Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady DuffGordon. She designs naughty lingerie, among her many talents. Very popular with the royals. Congratulations, Hockley. She's splendid. Why, thank you. Care to escort a lady to dinner? Certainly. Sweet pea? Ain't nothing to it, is there, Jack? Remember, they love money. So just pretend like you own a gold mine and you're in the club. Hey, Astor. Hello, Molly, nice to see you. J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson. How do you do? Pleasure. Well, Jack. are you of the Boston Dawsons? No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually. Oh, yes. He must have been nervous, but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of them. Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps. New money, obviously, but still a member of the club. Mother, of course, could always be counted upon. Tell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good on this ship. The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats. Mr. Dawson is joining us from the third class. He was of some assistance to my fiancee last night. It turns out that Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist. He was kind enough to show me some of his work today. Rose and I differ somewhat in our definition of fine art. Not to impugn your work, sir. Are these all for me? Just start from the outside and work your way in. He knows every rivet in her, don't you, Thomas? Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly. Thank you, Rose. How do you take your caviar, sir? No caviar for me, thanks. Never did like it much. And where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson? Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's good humor. And how is it you have means to travel? I work my way from place to place. You know, tramp steamers and such. But I won my ticket on Titanic here at a lucky hand at poker. A very lucky hand. All life is a game of luck. A real man makes his own luck, Archie. Right, Dawson? And you find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you? Yes, ma'am, I do. I mean, I've got everything I need right here with me. I got air in my lungs and a few blank sheets of paper. I love waking up in the morning not knowing what's gonna happen. or who I'm gonna meet. where I'm gonna wind up. Just the other night I was sleeping under a bridge, and now. here I am on the grandest ship in the world. having champagne with you fine people. I'll take some more of that. I figure life is a gift and I don't intend on wasting it. You never know what hand you're gonna get dealt next. You learn to take life as it comes at you. Here you go, Cal. To make each day count. Well said, Jack. Hear, hear. To making it count. To making it count! Bravo. But Mr. Brown had no idea I'd hidden the money in the stove. So he comes home drunk as a pig, celebrating, and he lights a fire. Bravo. Next it'll be brandies in the smoking room. Join me in a brandy, gentlemen? What a good idea. Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other. on being masters of the universe. Ladies, thank you for the pleasure of your company. Rose, may I escort you to the cabin? No, I'll stay here. Here you go, Molly. Joining us, Dawson? You don't want to stay out here with the women, do you? No, thanks, I've got to be heading back. Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. But, Dawson. good of you to come. Jack, must you go? Time for me to go row with the other slaves. Good night, Rose. So you want to go to a real party? Is okay if I put my hand here? Okay. What? I can't understand you. I'm going to dance with her now, all right? Come on. What? Come on. Come with me. Jack! Jack, wait. I can't do this. We're gonna have to get a little bit closer, like this. You're still my best girl, Cora. I don't know the steps. Neither do I, just go with it. Don't think. Wait, Jack! Stop! Stop! Wait! Jack, no. . beyond the jurisdiction of the Sherman Act. So my lawyers will argue. That's what Rockefeller said, but the Supreme Court is not swallowing it. What? You think a firstclass girl can't drink? Get out of here. You all right? I'm fine. 2 out of 3. So. you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this. Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. Are you all right? I haven't done that in years. Coffee, sir? I had hoped you would come to me last night. I was tired. Your exertions below decks were, no doubt, exhausting. I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me. How typical. You will never behave like that again, Rose, do you understand? I'm not a foreman in one of your mills that you can command. I'm your fiancee. My fiancee! Yes, you are, and my wife! My wife in practice, if not yet by law. So you will honor me. You'll honor me the way a wife is required to honor her husband. Because I will not be made out a fool, Rose. Is this in any way unclear? No. Good. Excuse me. Miss Rose. We had a little accident. That's all right, Miss Rose. Sorry, Trudy. It's all right. Let me help you. It's all right, miss. It's all right, miss. Tea, Trudy. Yes, ma'am. You are not to see that boy again. Do you understand me? Rose, I forbid it. Stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed. This is not a game. Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone. Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day. Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. That name is the only card we have to play. I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley. It will ensure our survival. How can you put this on my shoulders? Why are you being so selfish? I'm being selfish? Do you want to see me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? To see our fine things sold at auction? Our memories scattered to the winds? It's so unfair. Of course it's unfair. We're women. Our choices are never easy. Protect them by Thy guiding hand From every peril on the land O spirit whom the Father sent To spread abroad the firmament O wind of heaven, by thy might Save all who dare the eagle's flight And keep them by Thy watchful Hello, Mr. Andrews. Hello, Jack. I just need to talk to somebody for a second. Sir, you're not supposed to be in here. I just need to speak to someone. I was just here last night, you don't remember me? No, I'm afraid I don't. Now, you're gonna have to turn around. He'll tell you. I just need to talk Mr. Hockley and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater. continue to be appreciative of your assistance. They asked me to give you this in gratitude. I don't want your money. Please. I just Also to remind you that you hold a thirdclass ticket. and that your presence here is no longer appropriate. Please, I just wanna speak to Rose for one second. Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson gets back to where he belongs. and that he stays there. Yes, sir. Come along, you. Hear us when we cry to Thee For those in peril on the sea And why do you have 2 steering wheels? We really only use this near shore. Excuse me, sir. Another ice warning. This one is from the Noordam. Thank you, Sparks. Not to worry. Quite normal for this time of year. In fact, we're speeding up. I've just ordered the last boilers lit. Okay, son, wind it up tight like I showed you. That's right. Okay, now, let it go. That's excellent. Mr. Andrews, forgive me. I did the sum in my head. and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned. Forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard. About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these newtype davits. which can take an extra row of boats inside this one. But it was thought, by some. the deck would look too cluttered. So, I was overruled. It's a waste of deck space as it is in an unsinkable ship. Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship, strong and true. She's all the lifeboat you need. Keep heading aft. The next stop will be the engine room. Come on. Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you. I need to talk to you. No, Jack. No. Jack, I'm engaged. I'm marrying Cal. I love Cal. Rose, you're no picnic, all right? You're a spoiled little brat, even. But under that, you're the most amazingly. astounding, wonderful girl. Woman that I've ever known and Jack, I No, let me try to get this out. You're making. I'm not an idiot. I know how the world works. I've got $10 in my pocket. I have nothing to offer you and I know that. I understand. But I'm too involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowing you'll be all right. That's all that I want. Well, I'm fine. I'll be fine. Really. Really? I don't think so. They have got you trapped, Rose. And you're gonna die if you don't break free. Maybe not right away, because you're strong. but sooner or later, that fire that I love about you, Rose. that fire's going to burn out. It's not up to you to save me, Jack. You're right. Only you can do that. I'm going back. Leave me alone. Tell Lucile about the disaster you had with the stationers. Of course, the invitations had to be sent back, twice. Oh, my dear. And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns. Let me tell you, what an odyssey that has been. Rose decided she wanted lavender. She knows I detest the color. She did it to spite me. If only you'd come to me sooner. Ruth saw some of my designs in La Mode lllustree. they were for the trousseau. of the Duchess of Marlborough's youngest daughter. They were quite charming. I think you'll agree, my dear, that together. we've created something of a phoenix from the ashes. Hello, Jack. I changed my mind. They said you might be up here Give me your hand. Now close your eyes. Go on. Now step up. Now hold on to the railing. Keep your eyes closed. Don't peek. I'm not. Step up onto the rail. Hold on. Hold on. Keep your eyes closed. Do you trust me? I trust you. All right, open your eyes. I'm flying. Jack. Come, Josephine, in my flying machine Going up she goes, up she goes That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight. We're up to dusk, the night of the sinking. 6 hours to go. Incredible. There's Smith, and he's standing there. and he's got the iceberg warning in his fucking hand. Excuse me, his hand, and he's ordering more speed. 26 years of experience working against him. He figures anything big enough to sink the ship, they're gonna see in time to turn. But the ship's too big with too small a rudder. Doesn't corner worth a damn. Everything he knows is wrong. It's quite proper, I assure you. This is the sitting room. Will this light do? What? Don't artists need good light? That is true, but I'm not used to working in such horrible conditions. Monet! You know his work? Of course. Look at his use of color here. Isn't he great? I know. It's extraordinary. Cal insists on carting this hideous thing everywhere. Should we be expecting him anytime soon? Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out. That's nice. What is it, a sapphire? A diamond. A very rare diamond. Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls. Wearing this. All right. Wearing only this. The last thing I need. is another picture of me looking like a porcelain doll. As a paying customer. I expect to get what I want. Over on the bed. The couch. Lie down. Tell me when it looks right. Put your arm back the way it was. Put that other arm up, that hand right by your face there. Right. Now, head down. Eyes to me, keep them on me. And try to stay still. So serious. I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing. He does landscapes. Just relax your face. Sorry. No laughing. My heart was pounding the whole time. It was the most erotic moment of my life. up until then, at least. So what happened next? You mean, did we do it? Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine. Jack was very professional. Thank you. What are you doing? Will you put this back in the safe for me? Gentlemen, would you excuse me? Sure. None of the stewards have seen her. This is absurd. It's a ship. There's only so many places she could be. Lovejoy, find her. Clear. Yes. I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm. Like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind. It will make the 'bergs harder to see. with no breaking water at the base. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller. Yes, sir. It's getting cold. You look nice. Miss Rose? My drawings. Come on, Jack! Wait! Wait! Go! Take us down, quick. Go! Quickly! Quickly! Bye. Sorry. Keep going. Thank you, I've got it. Pretty tough for a valet, this fella. Seems more like a cop. I think he was. Oh, shit. Go! No, over here! Quick! Now what? What? More coal for number one, mate. What are you two doing down here? You shouldn't be down here. It could be dangerous! Carry on. Don't mind us. You're doing a great job. Keep up the good work! Look at what we have here. Thank you. Where to, miss? To the stars. You nervous? No. Put your hands on me, Jack. It's bloody cold. You know, I can smell ice, you know. When it's near. Bollocks! Well, I can, all right? Did you ever find those binoculars for the lookouts? Haven't seen them since Southampton. Well, I'll be on my rounds. Cheerio. You're trembling. Don't worry, I'll be all right. They ran down there. All right. Anything missing? I've got a better idea. Gotcha! Did you see those guys' faces? Did you see them? When the ship docks. I'm getting off with you. This is crazy. I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it. Here, look at this. Look at that, would you? They're a bit warmer than we are. If that's what it takes for us to get warm, I'd rather not. if it's all the same to you, all right? Bugger me! Pick up, you bastards! Is anyone there? Yes, what do you see? Iceberg, right ahead! Thank you. Iceberg, right ahead! Hard to starboard! Turn! Smartly! Full astern! Hard over. Helm's hard over, sir. Go, lads, go! Bring that steam down! Bring it down! Shut all the dampers! Shut them! Hold it. Now! Engage the reversing engine. Why ain't they turning? Is it hard over? It is. Yes, sir, hard over. Come on. Come on. Turn. Yes. It's gonna hit! Jesus Christ! Jesus. Hard to port! Hard to port! Get back! Come on, let's go! Get out of the door. They're closing the doors! Get out! Get out of the door! Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go! Out! Oh, my God. That was a close shave, wasn't it? Smell ice, can you? Bleeding Christ! Note the time and enter it in the log. What was that, Mr. Murdoch? An iceberg, sir. I put her hard to starboard, and ran the engines full astern, but it was too close. I tried to port round it, but she hit. Close the watertight doors. Doors are closed, sir. All stop. Aye, sir. Find the carpenter. Get him to sound the ship. Yes, sir. Come on, let's get the hell out of here. Come on, hurry up. Excuse me, why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder. I shouldn't worry, madam. We've likely thrown a propeller blade. That's the shudder you felt. May I bring you anything? No, thank you. So, now there's talk of an iceberg. Did you see anything? I don't see anything now. Do you? If this is the direction the rats are going, that's good enough for me. Everything's under control. You there. Sir, there is no emergency. Yes, there is. I've been robbed. Get the masteratarms. Now, you moron! Yes, sir. Hey, did I miss the fun? Did you see what happened? No, I missed it. Apparently, it hit over there. Boiler Room 6 is flooded 8 feet above the plate. and the mail hold is worse. She's all buckled in Can you shore up? Not unless the pumps get ahead. Have you seen the damage in the mail hold? No, she's already underwater. This is bad. We should tell Mother and Cal. I think they're very good, sir. Don't touch anything. I want the entire room photographed. We've been looking for you, miss. Here we go. Something serious has happened. Yes, it has. Indeed. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back, I have a pretty good idea where to find the other. Search him. Take your coat off, son. Now what? Come on, now. Cal, what are you doing? We're in the middle of an emergency. What's going on? Is this it? That's it. This is horseshit! Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't. He couldn't have. Of course he could. It's easy enough for a professional. But I was with him the whole time. This is absurd. Perhaps he did it while you were putting your clothes back on, dear. Real slick, Cal. Rose, they put it in my pocket. Shut up. It isn't even your pocket. Is it, son? Property of A.L. Ryerson. That was reported stolen today. I just borrowed it. I was gonna return it. An honest thief. We have an honest thief here, do we? You know I didn't do this, Rose. You know it. Don't believe them, Rose. You know it. You know I didn't do it. Come on, son. Let's go. Rose! Come on, there's a good lad. Come on. You know I didn't do it. You know me! This is most unfortunate, Captain. Water 14 feet above the keel in 10 minutes. in the forepeak, in all 3 holds, and in Boiler Room 6. That's right, sir. When can we get underway, damn it? That's 5 compartments. She can stay afloat with the first 4 compartments breached. but not 5. Not 5. As she goes down by the head. the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck. from one to the next, back and back. There's no stopping it. The pumps. We open the pumps. The pumps buy you time, but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do. Titanic will founder. But this ship can't sink. She's made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will. It is a mathematical certainty. How much time? An hour. Two, at most. And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch? 2,200 souls on board, sir. Well, I believe you may get your headlines, Mr. Ismay. Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it? You look at me when I'm talking to you! Mr. Hockley? Not now. We're busy. Sir, I've been told to ask you to put on your lifebelts. and come up to the boat deck. I said, not now. I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders. Now please, dress warmly. It's quite cold out tonight. Now, may I suggest topcoats and hats? This is ridiculous. Not to worry, miss. I'm sure it's just a precaution. Everybody up. Lifebelts on. What's he on about? Everybody up. Put your lifebelts on. What's the ruckus? Just put your lifebelts on. CQD? Sir? That's right, CQD, the distress call. That's our position. Tell whoever responds that we're going down by the head. and need immediate assistance. Blimey. Keep lowering! Steady! Make it taut! And winch out! Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft! Release those ties! Roll back that cover! Smartly now! Mr. Wilde, where are the passengers? They've all gone back inside. Too damn cold and noisy for them. You there! Get down here and help with these lines! Care for a drink, sir? Please put your lifebelts on. Sonny, what's doing? You got us all trussed up here and now we're cooling our heels. Sorry, ma'am. Let me go find out. I don't think anybody knows what the hell's going on around here. It's just the goddamned English, doing everything by the book. There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley. Go back and turn the heaters on in our rooms. I'd like a cup of tea when I return. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Andrews. I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth. The ship will sink. You're certain? Yes. In an hour or so. all this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. What? Please, tell only who you must. I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat. Quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats? Yes. I understand. Yes, madam, please put it on immediately. Over here, son. Sir, they need you up at the secondclass purser's office. There's a big mob up there. Go on. I'll keep an eye on him. Aye. Right. Sir! Carpathia says they're making 17 knots. Full steam for them, sir. She's the only one who's responding? The only one close, sir. Says they can be here in 4 hours. 4 hours! Thank you, Bride. My God. We are swung out and ready, sir. Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir? Yes. Sir? Women and children first, yes. Yes, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please! Step this way, please. That's right. Come towards me. Thank you. Good. For the time being, I shall require only women and children. Gentlemen, please. Right here. All right, boys. Like the Captain said, nice and cheery, so there's no panic. Wedding Dance. Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on. Here, put your lifebelt on. Yeah, come on. Put your lifebelt on. Turn that around. Please. It isn't time to go up to the boats yet! Please stay calm. Make sure, everybody, you've got your lifebelts on. And, gentlemen, allow the women and children through to the front. What are we doing, Mommy? We're just waiting, dear. When they finish putting firstclass people in the boats. they will be starting with us and we'll want to be all ready, won't we? Everybody, not just right yet. Don't push on the gates. You won't get out any faster. Someone help. Go and get some help. Lower it away, left and right together! Both sides together! Steady! Steady! Stop! Hold the left side! Right side only! Right side only. Hold the left side! Lower away together! Steady, lads! You know, I do believe this ship may sink. I've been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation. Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley. Come on, sister. You heard the man. Into the boat. Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen? Only women at this time, sir. Will the lifeboats be seated according to class? I hope they're not too crowded. Oh, Mother, shut up! Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats. Not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die. Not the better half. Come on, Ruth, get in the boat. Firstclass seats are right up here. You know, it's a pity I didn't keep that drawing. It'll be worth a lot more by morning. Women and children towards the front, please. You unimaginable bastard. Come on, Rose, darling. There's plenty of room for you. Right this way, miss. Come on, Rose. You're next, darling. Come into the boat, Rose. Come. Rose? Get into the boat. Rose? Goodbye, Mother. Rose? Rose, come back here. Where are you going? To him? What, to be a whore to a gutter rat? No, wait. I'd rather be his whore than your wife. No! I said, no! Rose, please stop! Lower away! No, stop! All together. No, wait! Lower away! Rose! Help! Can anybody hear me? Hello! Help me! Mr. Andrews! Steward, check the starboard corridor. Yes, Mr. Andrews. Madam, please, put on a lifebelt. Get to the boat deck immediately. Lucy, for God's sake, put on a lifebelt and set a good example. Yes, sir. Anyone in here? Mr. Andrews? Thank God. Where would the masteratarms take someone under arrest? You have to get to a boat right away. No! I'm doing this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer. Take the elevator to the very bottom. Go to the left. Down the crewmen's passage, then go right and left again at the stairs. You'll come to a long corridor. This could be bad. Oh, shit! Excuse me. Thank you. I do not care what you think, sir. Lifts are closed. I'm sorry, miss, but the lifts are closed. I'm through being polite, God damn it! Now, take me down! E deck. Come on. I'm going back up. No. Come back! I'm going back up! Crew passage. Jack! Rose! Jack! Rose, I'm in here! Jack! Jack! Rose! Jack! Jack, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That guy, Lovejoy, put it in my pocket. I know. I know. Listen, Rose. you're gonna have to find a spare key, all right? Look in that cabinet right there. It's a little silver one, Rose. Silver. These are all brass ones! Check right here, Rose. Rose. how'd you find out I didn't do it? I didn't. I just realized I already knew. Keep looking. No key. There's no key! All right, Rose, listen. You're gonna have to go find some help. It'll be all right. I'll be right back. I'll just wait here! Hello? Is there anyone here? Hello? Is there anybody down here? We need help! Hello? Damn it. Can anybody hear me, please? Hello? Oh, thank God. Wait, I need your help. There's a man back here. Wait! Hello? Hello? Miss, you shouldn't be here now. I need your help. We'll get you topside. This way, quickly. There's a man down here. He's trapped. This way. There is no need to panic. Please! No, I'm not panicking! You're going the wrong way! Let go of me! Listen! The hell with you. Oh, my God. Jack! Rose! Will this work? I guess we'll find out. Come on. Wait. Try a couple of practice swings over there. Good. Now try to hit the same mark again, Rose. You can do it. Okay. That's enough practice. Come on, Rose. You can do it. Listen, just hit it really hard and really fast. Come on. Wait. Open your hands up a little more. Good. Like that? Right. Listen, Rose, I trust you. Go. You did it! Come on, let's go. Oh, shit, this is cold! This is the way out. We have to find another way. Come on. Now there's something you don't see every day. What's this luggage doing here? Get rid of it. We need the room. Get rid of that! Out! Come. Time for her to go, sir. Step back. Keep calm. Sit down. No. No! Make more room. That's right. Look sharp. Lovejoy. She's not on the starboard side, either. We're running out of time. This strutting martinet isn't letting any men on at all. There's one on the other side letting men on. Then that's our play. We'll need some insurance first. Come on. Come on, this way, please. All the way down there. Here! What do you think you're doing? You'll have to pay for that, you know. That's White Star Line property. Shut up! Will you hold the boat a moment? I just have to run back to my room. Sit down. She's the last. Mr. Lightoller, why are the boats being launched halffull? Not now, Mr. Andrews. There, look. 20 or so in a boat built for 65? And I saw one boat with only 12. 12! We weren't sure of the weight, Mr. Andrews. These boats may buckle. Rubbish! They were tested in Belfast with the weight of 70 men. Now fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller. For God's sake, man! Please, I need more women and children! Get back in there! This is not an exit. Get back in there. You can't keep us locked in here like animals. The ship's bloody sinking. Bring forward the women. Unlock the gates. Women only! Lock the gates! For God's sake, man, there are women and children down here! Let us up, so we can have a chance! Get back! Jack. Tommy. Can we get out? It's hopeless that way. Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast. Jack! Fabrizio. The boats are all gone. This whole place is flooding. We've got to get out. There is niente this way. All right. Let's go this way, all right? Come on. I make my own luck. So do I. Come on! No, come on, let's go this way. This way. Just go back to the main stairwell and everything will be sorted out there. The hell it will. It will all get sorted out back there. Go back to the main stairwell. Open the gate. Go back down the main stairwell. Open the gate right now. Go back down the main stairwell like I told you! God damn it! Son of a bitch! Stop that! Open the damn gate! Fabri, Tommy, give me hand here. Move aside. Move aside! Pull! Pull! Move aside. Put that down! Move aside! Put that down! One! Two! Stop that! Three! Again! Let's go! Let's go, Rose. You can't go up there! You can't do this! Keep order here! Get back. Get back! Hold on to her! Pull her in. Get back, I say. or I'll shoot you all like dogs! Keep order here! Keep order, I say. Mr. Lowe, man this boat. Right. Is everybody all right? Nobody panic. Stay back! We're too late. There are more boats down the front. Stay with this one. Murdoch. He seems to be quite practical. Stop lowering! Stop lowering! Cut the falls! Sit down! Stay back, you lot! Just stay back! Stay back, the lot of you! Just stay back! It's starting to fall apart. We don't have much time. Mr. Murdoch? Mr. Hockley. You two, with me, now! I'm a businessman, as you know, I have a business proposition for you. Come on, Rose. The boats are gone! Colonel, are there any boats on that side? No, miss, but there are a couple of boats all the way forward. This way, I'll lead you. What's the use? Nobody's listening to us anyway. They don't listen to us at dinner, either. Come on, let's play. Keep us warm. Orpheus. Music to drown by. Now I know I'm in first class. Where is everyone? They're all still aft, sir. Come on, madam, don't cry. We have an understanding, then, Mr. Murdoch. Will the men please hold back? Hold back, I say! Women and children only! Get back! I said, step back, sir. Come through, madam. This way. Step back, sir! Let the women You better check the other side. Go! I found her, on the other side. Waiting for a boat. with him. Any more women and children? They're all aboard, Mr. Murdoch. Anyone else then? Hop on, sir. Anyone else? Do hurry. Hurry along. Stand by the falls. God damn it all to hell. Shit. Fire! Sir, you can't go through here. Sir, you can't go through. That's it. Splendid. Right. Prepare to lower! Ready on the left! Take them down. Keep it steady. Both sides together. Steady. Keep it steady. Give her to me. Daddy. It'll be fine, darling. Don't you worry. Take her. Daddy, get in the boat. It's goodbye for a little while. Only for a little while. There'll be another boat for the daddies. this boat's for the mommies and the children. You hold Mommy's hand and be a good little girl. I'm not going without you. No. You have to go, now. No, Jack. Get in the boat, Rose. No, Jack. Yes. Get on the boat. Yes, get on the boat, Rose. My God. Look at you. You look a fright. Here. Put this on. Come on. Go on. I'll get the next one. No, not without you. I'll be all right. Listen, I'll be fine. I'm a survivor, all right? Don't worry about me. Now, go on. Get on. I have an arrangement with an officer on the other side of the ship. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us. See? I got my own boat to catch. Go. Come on, hurry. They're almost full. Step aboard, miss. Go. Come on, hurry. Step aboard, please. You're Daddy's good girl. Step lively! Keep back. Keep back, I say. Clear the rail, please. Lower away! Steady. And lower away evenly, lads. Easy. Lower away. You're a good liar. Almost as good as you. Easy, now. And lower away. There's no. There's no arrangement, is there? No, there is. Not that you'll benefit much from it. And even away. I always win, Jack. And lower away evenly, lads. One way or another. Watch that trim. Trim that boat. Easy. Even, lads. Keep going! Rose! Stop her! Rose! What are you doing? Stop her! No! Rose! You're so stupid! Why did you do that? You're so stupid, Rose. Why did you do that? Why? You jump, I jump, right? Right. Oh, God. I couldn't go. I couldn't go, Jack. It's all right. We'll think of something. At least I'm with you. Come on! Move! Come on! Come on! Move! Come on! Move! Come on, come on, Rose! Rose, come on! Move, Rose! Go! I hope you enjoy your time together! What could possibly be funny? I put the diamond in the coat. And I put the coat on her! Come on. Dada! We can't leave him. All right, come on! Dada! Go back! That's the wrong way! Come back! Go! Go! Run, Rose! Jack! Jack! Rose! This way! Come on! Give me your hand! Oh, God! Help! Help! Wait, sir! Sir, open the gate, please! Please! Please, help us! Please! Please! Bloody hell! Hurry. Come on, come on! Come on! Go, go! Jesus. Please! Come on! Hurry! Come on! I'm sorry, I dropped the keys. Wait, please! Wait! Don't leave!

Come on, Rose. Stay on it. Stay on, Rose. It'll be all right now. You'll be all right now. Return the boats! The boats are coming back for us, Rose. Hold on just a little bit longer. They had to row away for the suction. but now they'll be coming back. For God's sake! Please help us! You don't understand. If we go back, they'll swamp the boat. They'll pull us right down, I'm telling you. Knock it off. You're scaring me. Come on, girls, grab an oar. Let's go. Are you out of your mind? We're in the middle of the North Atlantic. Now, do you people want to live or do you want to die? I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men out there! There's plenty of room for more. And there'll be one less on this boat. If you don't shut that hole in your face! Bring in your oars over there. Tie these two boats together as well. Now, make sure that's tied up nice and tight. Right, listen to me, men. We have to go back. I want to transfer all the women from this boat into that boat right now. As quick as you can, please. Let's create some space over there. Move forward and out. It's getting quiet. It's just going to take a couple of minutes to get the boats organized. I don't know about you. but I intend to write a stronglyworded letter. to the White Star Line about all this. I love you, Jack. Don't you do that. Don't you say your goodbyes. Not yet. Do you understand me? I'm so cold. Listen, Rose. you're gonna get out of here. You're gonna go on. and you're gonna make lots of babies. And you're gonna watch them grow. You're gonna die an old lady, warm in her bed. Not here. Not this night. Not like this. Do you understand me? I can't feel my body. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me. It brought me to you. And I'm thankful for that, Rose. I'm thankful. You must. do me this honor. You must promise me that you'll survive. That you won't give up. no matter what happens. No matter how hopeless. Promise me now, Rose. And never let go of that promise. I promise. Never let go. I'll never let go, Jack. I'll never let go. Right ahead, sir. Oars! Do you see any moving? No, sir. None moving, sir. Check them. Bring that oar up here. Check them. Make sure. These are dead, sir. Now give way. Ahead easy. Careful with your oars. Don't hit them. Is there anyone alive out there? Can anyone hear me? Is there anyone alive out there? We waited too long. Keep checking them! Keep looking! Is there anyone alive out there? Can anyone hear me? In my flying machine And up she goes Up she goes Come, Josephine In my flying machine Jack? There's a boat. Jack? There's a boat, Jack. Come back. Come back! Hello! Can anyone hear me? There's nothing here, sir. Come back. I'll never let go. I promise. Come about! 1,500 people went into the sea. when Titanic sank from under us. There were 20 boats floating nearby. and only one came back. One. 6 were saved from the water. myself included. 6 out of 1,500. Afterward, the 700 people in the boats. had nothing to do but wait. Wait to die, wait to live. Wait for an absolution. that would never come. Sir, I don't think you'll find any of your people down here. It's all steerage. His hair is reddish brown, and a white beard. Isn't there another passenger list? There's no other list. Perhaps he's on another ship. We're doing all we can. That's the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course, and inherited his millions. But the crash of '29 hit his interests hard. And he put a pistol in his mouth that year. Or so I read. Can I take your name, please, love? Dawson. Rose Dawson. Thank you. We never found anything on Jack. There's no record of him at all. No, there wouldn't be, would there? And I've never spoken of him until now. Not to anyone. Not even your grandfather. A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. But now you know there was a man named Jack Dawson. and that he saved me. in every way that a person can be saved. I don't even have a picture of him. He exists now only in my memory. Keldysh, Mir2 on our way to the surface. I was saving this for when I found the diamond. I'm sorry. 3 years. I've thought of nothing except Titanic. But I never got it. I never let it in. Every night in my dreams I see you I feel you That is how I know you go on. Far across the distance And spaces between us You have come to show you go on. Near Far Wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on. Once more you open the door and you're here in my heart and my heart will go on and on. Love can touch just one time and last for a lifetime and never let go till we're gone. Love was when I loved you One true time I hold to In my life we'll always go on. Near Far Wherever you are I believe that the heart does go on. Once more you open the door and you're here in my heart and my heart will go on and on. You're here There's nothing I fear And I know that my heart will go on. We'll stay forever this way You are safe in my heart and my heart will go on and on and love.
