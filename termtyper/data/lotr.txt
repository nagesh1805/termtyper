I amar prestar aen. The world is changed. Han mathon ne nen. I feel it in the water. Han mathon ne chae. I feel it in the earth. A han noston ned 'wilith. I smell it in the air. Much that once was. is lost. For none now live who remember it. The Lord of the Rings. It began with the forging of the great rings. Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine. nine rings were gifted to the race of men. who, above all else, desire power. For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them deceived. For another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom. the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring. to control all others. And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice. and his will to dominate all life. One ring to rule them all. One by one. the free lands of Middleearth fell to the power of the ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middleearth. Victory was near. But the power of the ring. could not be undone. It was in this moment. when all hope had faded. that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword. Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples of Middleearth, was defeated. The ring passed to Isildur. who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. But the hearts of men. are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its own. It betrayed Isildur. to his death. And some things that should not have been forgotten. were lost. History became legend. legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years. the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came. it ensnared a new bearer. My precious. The ring came to the creature Gollum. who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it consumed him. It came to me. My own. My love. My own. My precious. The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For 500 years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East. whispers of a nameless fear. And the ring of power perceived. its time had now come. It abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. What's this? A hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. A ring. Lost! The 22nd day of September. My precious is lost! For the time will soon come. when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all. in the year 1400. by Shirereckoning. Bag End, Bagshot Row. Hobbiton, Westfarthing. the Shire. Middleearth. The third age of this world. The Fellowship of the Ring. There and back again. A Hobbit's tale. By Bilbo Baggins. Now. where to begin? Ah, yes.. Concerning. Hobbits. Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire. for many hundreds of years. quite content to ignore and be ignored. by the world of the big folk. Middleearth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Hobbits must seem of little importance. being neither renowned as great warriors. nor counted among the very wise. Frodo! Someone at the door. In fact, it has been remarked by some. that Hobbits' only real passion is for food. A rather unfair observation. as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales. and the smoking of pipeweed. But where our hearts truly lie. is in peace and quiet. and good, tilled earth. For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow. And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint. But today of all days. It is brought home to me. It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life. Frodo, the door! Sticklebacks. Where is that boy? Frodo! Down from the door where it began And I must follow if I can The road goes ever on and on Down from the door where it began Now far ahead the road has gone And I must follow if I can You're late. A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to. It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf! You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday? How is the old rascal? I hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence. You know Bilbo. He's got the whole piece in an uproar. Well, that should please him. Half the Shire's been invited. And the rest of them are turning up anyway. And so life in the Shire goes on. very much as it has this past age. Full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly. If it comes at all. For things are made to endure in the Shire. passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill. in Bag End. And there always will be. To tell you the truth, Bilbo's been a bit odd lateIy. I mean, more than usual. He's taken to locking himself in his study. He spends hours and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking. Where's it gone? He's up to something. All right, then. Keep your secrets. What? But I know you have something to do with it. Good gracious me. Before you came along, we Bagginses were very well thought of. Indeed. Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected. If you're referring to the incident with the dragon. I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door. Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace. Oh, really? Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks, Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks, Gandalf! Gandalf? I'm glad you're back. So am I, dear boy. So am I. No, thank you! We don't want any more visitors, wellwishers or distant relations! And what about very old friends? Gandalf? Bilbo Baggins. My dear Gandalf! Good to see you. 111 years old! Who would believe it? You haven't aged a day. Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome. Oh, here we are. Tea.or maybe something a littIe stronger? I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left 1296. Very good year. Almost as old as I am. It was laid down by my father. What say we open one, eh? Just tea, thank you. I was expecting you sometime last week. Not that it matters. You come and go as you please. Always have and always will. You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid. We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle.. There's some cheese here. No, that won't do. We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart.. But not much for afters. Oh, no, we're all right. I've just found some sponge cake. I could make you some eggs if you'd li. Just tea, thank you. Oh, right. You don't mind if I eat, do you? No, not at all. Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins! I'm not at home! It's the SackvilleBagginses. I know you're in there! They're after the house. They've never forgiven me for living this long. I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day. never giving me a moment's peace. I want to see mountains again. Mountains, Gandalf! And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea. So you mean to go through with your plan? Yes, yes. It's all in hand. All the arrangements are made. Oh, thank you. Frodo suspects something. Of course he does. He's a Baggins. not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle. You will tell him, won't you? Yes, yes. He's very fond of you. I know. He'd probably come with me if I asked him. I think in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire. The woods, the fields. Little rivers. I am old, Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. I feel thin. Sort of stretched. like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday. A very Long holiday. And I don't expect I shall return. In fact, I mean not to. Old Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing. Gandalf, my old friend. this will be a night to remember. Hello, hello. Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you. Welcome, welcome. Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance. I think I'll just have another ale. Oh, no, you don't. Go on! So there I was. at the mercy of three monstrous trolls. And they were all arguing amongst themselves. about how they were going to cook us. Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly. They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors. that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees. and turned them all to stone! Quickly. Up they go! No no, the big one big one Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you. Welcome, welcome. Are all these children yours? Good gracious, you have been productive. Bilbo? SackvilleBagginses! Quickly, hide! Thank you, my boy. You're a good lad, Frodo. I'm very selfish, you know. Yes, I am. Very selfish. I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died. but it wasn't out of charity. I think it was because. of all my numerous relations. you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit. Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew? No. Well, yes, but that's not the point. The point is, Frodo. you'll be all right. Done! You're supposed to stick it in the ground. It is in the ground. Outside! This was your idea. Bilbo. Bilbo, watch out for the dragon! Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for thousands of years. That was good. Let's get another one. Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took. I might've known. Speech, Bilbo! Speech! Speech! My dear Bagginses and Boffins. Tooks and Brandybucks. Grubbs, Chubbs. Hornblowers. Bolgers. Bracegirdles. and Proudfoots. Proudfeet! Today is my 111th birthday! Happy birthday! But alas, eleventhone years is far too short a time to live among. such excellent and admirable Hobbits. I don't know half of you half as well as I should like. and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve. I have things to do. I've put this off for far too long. I regret to announce this is the end! I'm going now. I bid you all a very fond farewell. Goodbye. I suppose you think that was terribly clever. Come on, Gandalf. Did you see their faces? There are many magic rings in this world, Bilbo Baggins. and none of them should be used lightly. It was just a bit of fun. Oh, you're probably right, as usual. You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you? Two eyes. As often as I can spare them. I'm leaving everything to him. What about this ring of yours? Is that staying too? Yes, yes. It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece. No. Wait, it's. here in my pocket. Isn't that? Isn't that odd, now? Yet, after all, why not? Why shouldn\x19 t I keep it? I think you should leave the ring behind. Is that so hard? Well, no. And yes. Now it comes to it, I don't feel l ike parting with it. It's mine. I found it! It came to me! There's no need to get angry. Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's mine. My own. My precious. Precious? It's been called that before, but not by you. What business is it of yours what I do with my own things? I think you've had that ring quite long enough. You want it for yourself! Bilbo Baggins! Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks. I am not trying to rob you. I'm trying to help you. All your long years, we've been friends. Trust me as you once did. Let it go. You're right, Gandalf. The ring must go to Frodo. It's late. The road is long. Yes, it is time. Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket. And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days. And I'm sure you will, my dear friend. Goodbye, Gandalf. Goodbye, dear Bilbo. The road goes ever on and on. Until our next meeting. It's mine. My own. My precious. Riddles in the dark. Bilbo! Bilbo! My precious. Precious. He's gone, hasn't he? He talked for so long about leaving. I didn't think he'd really do it. Gandalf? Bilbo's ring. He's gone to stay with the elves. He's left you Bag End. Along with all his possessions. The ring is yours now. Put it somewhere out of sight. Where are you going? There are some things that I must see to. What things? Questions. Questions that need answering. You've only just arrived. I don't understand. Neither do I. Keep it secret. Keep it safe. Shire! Baggins! The year 3434 of the second age. Here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor. and the finding of the ring of power. It has come to me. The one ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom. All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate. for I will risk no hurt to the ring. It is precious to me. though I buy it with great pain. The markings upon the band begin to fade. The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared. A secret now that only fire can tell. Shire. Baggins. There's no Bagginses around here. They're all up in Hobbiton. That way. Hey ho to the dock I go To heal my heart and drown my woe Rain may fall and wind may blow But there still be. many miles to go Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain And the stream that falls from hill to plain Better than rain or rippling brook Is a mug of beer inside this Took! There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire. Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature. War is brewing. The mountains are fair teeming with goblins. Faroff tales and children\x19 s stories, that's all that is. You're beginning to sound like that old Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was. Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking. And proud of it. Cheers, Gaffer. Aye. Cheers. Weel it's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. Keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble'll come to you. Good night, lads. Good night. Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale. Mind who you're sweettaking. Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one. Does she? Good night, Sam. Good night, Mr. Frodo. Is it secret? Is it safe? What are you doing? Hold out your hand, Frodo. It's quite cool. What can you see? Can you see anything? Nothing. There's nothing. Wait. There are markings. It's some form of Elvish. I can't read it. There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here. Mordor! One ring to rule them all. One ring to find them. One ring to bring them all. and in the darkness bind them. This is the One ring. forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. Taken by IsiIdur from the hand of Sauron himself. Bilbo found it. In Gollum's cave. Yes. For 60 years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping. prolonging his life, delaying old age. But no longer, Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The ring has awoken. It's heard its master's call. But he was destroyed. Sauron was destroyed. No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life force is bound to the ring, and the ring survived. Sauron has returned. His orcs have multiplied. His fortress at Baradd˚r is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness. He is seeking it. Seeking it All his thought is bent on it. For the ring yearns above all else. to return to the hand of its master. They are one. the ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo. he must never find it. All right. We put it away. We keep it hidden. We never speak of it again. No one knows it's here, do they? Do they, Gandalf? There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum. But the enemy found him first. I don't know how long they tortured him. But amidst the endless screams and Shire! Baggins! Shire. Baggins. But that would lead them here! Who goes there? Take it, Gandalf! Take it! No, Frodo. You must take it! You cannot offer me this ring! I'm giving it to you! Don't tempt me, Frodo! I dare not take it. Not even to keep it safe. Understand, Frodo. I would use this ring from a desire to do good. But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine. But it cannot stay in the Shire! No. No, it can't. What must I do? You must leave. And leave quickly. Where? Where do I go? Get out of the Shire. Make for the village of Bree. Bree. What about you? I'll be waiting for you. at the inn of the Prancing Pony. And the ring will be safe there? I don't know, Frodo. I don't have any answers. I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo. He'll know what to do. You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you. That name is not safe outside the Shire. Travel only by day. And stay off the road. I can cut across country easily enough. My dear Frodo. Hobbits really are amazing creatures. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month. And yet, after a hundred years. they can still surprise you. Get down. Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping? I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there.If you follow me. A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think? I heard raised voices. What did you hear? Speak! Nothing important. That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, and a Dark Lord. and something about the end of the world but. Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anything unnatural. No? Perhaps not. I've thought of a better use for you. Come along, Samwise. Keep up. Be careful, both of you. Birds, beasts. Is it safe? Never put it on. for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power. Always remember, Frodo. the ring is trying to get back to its master. It wants to be found. This is it. This is what? If I take one more step. it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been. Come on, Sam. It's a dangerous business, Frodo. Going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet. there's no knowing where you might be swept off to. Sam. Woodelves. They're going to the harbor beyond the White Towers. To the Grey Havens. They're leaving Middleearth. Never to return. I don't know why. it makes me sad. Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back. Just shut your eyes. and imagine you're back in your own bed. with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow. It's not working, Mr. Frodo. I'm never going to be able to sleep out here. Me neither, Sam. Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom. The hour grows late. And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard. seeking my counsel. For that is why you have come, is it not? My old friend. Saruman. You are sure of this? Beyond any doubt. So the ring of power has been found. All these long years, it was in the Shire. Under my very nose. Yet you did not have the wit to see it. Your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind. But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly. Time? What time do you think we have? Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form. but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf. A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. The eye of Sauron. He is gathering all evil to him. Very soon, he'll have summoned an army. great enough for an assault upon Middleearth. You know this? How? I have seen it. A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman. Why? Why should we fear to use it? They are not all accounted for, the lost seeingstones. We do not know who else may be watching. The hour is later than you think. Sauron's forces are already moving. The Nine have left Minas Morgul. The Nine? They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve. disguised as riders in black. They've reached the Shire? They will find the ring. And kill the one who carries it. Frodo! You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can. Against the power of Mordor. there can be no victory. We must join with him, Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It would be wise, my friend. Tell me. friend. when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness? I gave you the chance of. aiding me willingly. but you have elected the way of pain! Mr. Frodo? Frodo? Frodo! I thought I'd lost you. What are you taking about? It's just something Gandalf said. What did he say? Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee. And I don't mean to. Sam, we're still in the Shire. What could possibly happen? Frodo. Merry, it's Frodo Baggins. Hello, Frodo. Get off him. Come on, Frodo. What's the meaning of this? You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop! You get back here! Get out of my field! You'll know the devil if I catch up with you! I don't know why he's so upset. It's only a couple of carrots. And some cabbages. And those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week. And then the mushrooms the week before. Yes, Pippin. My point is. he's clearly overreacting. Run! Oh, that was close. I think I've broken something. Trust a Brandybuck and a Took! What? That was just a detour. A short cut. Short cut to what? Mushrooms! That's mine. That's nice, Merry. Here's a nice one, Sam. I think we should get off the road. Get off the road! Quick! Be quiet! What was that? Anything? Nothing. What is going on? That Black Rider was looking for something. Or someone. Frodo? Get down! I have to leave the Shire. Sam and I must get to Bree. Right. Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me. Run! This way! Follow me! Run! Get the rope, Sam! Frodo! Run, Frodo! Go! Hurry! Frodo, come on! Come on! Faster! Jump! How far to the nearest crossing? The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles. Come on. What do you want? We're heading for the Prancing Pony. Hobbits. Four hobbits! What's more, out of the Shire by your talk. What business brings you to Bree? We wish to stay at the inn. Our business is our own. All right young sir, I meant no offense. It's my job to ask questions after nightfall. There's talk of strange folk abroad. Can't be too careful. Out of the way! Watch where you're walking. Excuse me. Good evening, little masters. What can I do for you? If you're looking for accommodation, we got some nice cozy hobbitsized rooms available. Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister.? Underhill. My name's Underhill. Underhill, yeah. We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can you tell him we've arrived? Gandalf? Gandalf. Oh, yes. I remember. Elderly chap. Big grey beard, pointy hat. Not seen him for six months. What do we do now? Sam. he'll be here. He'll come. Get out of my way! What's that? This, my friend, is a pint. It comes in pints? I'm getting one. You got a whole half already! That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived. Excuse me. That man in the corner. Who is he? He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. What his right name is, I've never heard, but 'round here he's known as Strider. Strider. Baggins. Baggins. Baggins. Baggins. Baggins. Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins. He's over there. Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin, once removed on his mother's side. and my third cousin, twice removed.. Pippin! Steady on, Frodo. You cannot hide. I see you. There is no life. in the void. Only. death. You draw far too much attention to yourself, Mr. Underhill. What do you want? A little more caution from you. That is no trinket you carry. I carry nothing. Indeed. I can avoid being seen if I wish. but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift. Who are you? Are you frightened? Yes. Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you. Let him go! Or I'll have you, Longshanks. You have a stout heart, little hobbit. But that will not save you. You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo. They're coming. What are they? They were once men. Great kings of men. Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed, they took them without question. One by one, falling into darkness. Now they are slaves to his will. They are the Nazg˚l. Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead. At all times they feel. the presence of the ring. drawn to the power of the One. They will never stop hunting you. Where are you taking us? Into the wild. How can we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf? I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer. and feel fouler. He's foul enough. We have no choice but to trust him. But where is he leading us? To Rivendell, Master Gamgee. To the house of Elrond. Did you hear that? Rivendell. We're going to see the elves. Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall. What about breakfast? You've already had it. We've had one, yes. What about second breakfast? Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip. What about elevenses? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper? He knows about them, doesn't he? I wouldn't count on it. Pippin! What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit? Tin˙viel elvanui Elleth alfirin ethelhael O hon ring finnil fuinui A renc gelebrin thiliol. Who is she? This woman you sing of. 'Tis the lady of Luthien. The elfmaiden who gave her love to Beren, a mortal. What happened to her? She died. Get some sleep, Frodo. The power of Isengard is at your command. Sauron, Lord of the Earth. Build me an army worthy of Mordor. What orders from Mordor, my lord? What does the Eye command? We have work to do. The trees are strong, my lord. Their roots go deep. Rip them all down. This was the great watchtower of Amon S˚l. We shall rest here tonight. These are for you. Keep them close. I'm going to have a look around. Stay here. My tomato's burst. Could I have some bacon? Want a tomato, Sam? What are you doing?! Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon. We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo. Put it out, you fools! Put it out! That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes! Go! Back, you devils! Frodo! Oh, Sam. Strider! Help him, Strider. He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade. This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs elvish medicine. Hurry! We're six days from Rivendell! He'll never make it! Hold on, Frodo. Gandalf! Gwaihir Go. Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls. Mr. Frodo? He's going cold. Is he going to die? He's passing into the shadow world. He'll soon become a wraith like them. They're close. Sam, do you know the Athelas plant? Athelas? Kingsfoil. Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed. It may help to slow the poisoning. Hurry! What's this, a ranger caught off his guard? Frodo. Im Arwen Telin le thaed. Lasto beth nÓn, tolo dan na ngalad. Who is she? Frodo. She's an elf. He's fading. He's not going to last. We must get him to my father. I've been looking for you for two days. Where are you taking him? There are five wraiths behind you. Where the other four are, I do not know. Dartho guin Berian. Rych le ad tolthathon. Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im. Andelu i ven. What are they saying? Frodo fÓr. Ae athradon i hÓr. t˚r gwaith nÓn beriatha hon. I do not fear them. Be iest lÓn. Arwen. ride hard. Don't Look back. What are you doing?! Those wraiths are still out there! Noro lim, Asfaloth! Give up the halfling, Sheelf. If you want him, come and claim him. NÓn o Chithaeglir. lasto beth daer Rimmo n∆\x02n Bruinen dan in Ulaer! NÓn o Chithaeglir. lasto beth daer Rimmo n∆\x02n Bruinen dan in Ulaer! No. No! Frodo, no. Frodo, don't give in. Not now. What grace is given me. let it pass to him. Let him be spared. Save him. Lasto beth nÓn, tolo dan na ngalad. Where am I? You are in the house of Elrond. And it is 10 o'clock in the morning on October 24th, if you want to know. Gandalf! Yes, I'm here. And you're lucky to be here too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit. What happened, Gandalf? Why didn't you meet us? I am sorry, Frodo. I was delayed. A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside. One ill turn deserves another. It is over. Embrace the power of the ring. or embrace your own destruction! There is only one lord of the ring. Only one who can bend it to his will. And he does not share power. So you have chosen.death. Gandalf? What is it? Nothing, Frodo. Frodo! Sam. Bless you, you're awake! Sam has hardly left your side. We were that worried about you. Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf? By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend. Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins. Bilbo! Hello, Frodo, my lad. Bilbo. There and back again A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins. This is wonderful. I meant to go back. wonder at the powers of Mirkwood. visit Laketown. see the Lonely Mountain again. But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me. I miss the Shire. I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else. Off with you, on one of your adventures. But my own adventure turned out to be quite different. I'm not like you, Bilbo. My dear boy. Now, what have I forgotten? Packed already? No harm in being prepared. I thought you wanted to see the elves. I do. More than anything. I did. It's just.. We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we? We got the ring this far, to Rivendell. And I thought. seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. Off home. You are right, Sam. We did what we set out to do. The ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am ready to go home. His strength returns. That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life. And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring. the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil. It is a burden he should never have had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo. Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's forces are massing in the East. His eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin. His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft, Saruman has crossed orcs with goblinmen. He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the ring. This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the elves. We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard! Gandalf. the ring cannot stay here. This peril belongs to all Middleearth. They must decide now how to end it. The time of the elves is over. My people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we've gone? The dwarves? They hide in mountains seeking riches. They care not for the troubles of others. It is in men that we must place our hope. Men? Men are weak. The race of men is failing. The blood of Numenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of men the ring survives. I was there, Gandalf. I was there 3000 years ago. when Isildur took the ring. I was there the day the strength of men failed. Isildur, hurry! Follow me. I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom. where the ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed. Cast it into the fire! Destroy it! No. Isildur! It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the ring. The line of kings is broken. There's no strength left in the world of men. They're scattered, divided, leaderless. There is one who could unite them. One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor. He turned from that path a long time ago. He has chosen exile. You are no elf. Men of the South are welcome here. Who are you? I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey. Then we are here on common purpose. friend. The shards of Narsil. The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand. It's still sharp. But no more than a broken heirloom. Why do you fear the past? You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf. You are not bound to his fate. The same blood flows in my veins. The same weakness. Your time will come. You will face the same evil. And you will defeat it. A si iDhuath ˙orthor, Aragorn. ⁄ or le a ˙ or nin. Renich i l˙ i erui govannem? Nauthannen i ned Ùl reniannen. Gwenwin in enninath. ⁄'arnech in naeth i si celich. Renech i beth i pennen? You said you'd bind yourself to me. forsaking the immortal life of your people. And to that I hold. I would rather share one lifetime with you. than face all the ages of this world alone. I choose a mortal life. You cannot give me this. It is mine to give to whom I will. like my heart. Strangers from distant lands, friends of old. you've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middleearth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You will unite, or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom. Bring forth the ring, Frodo. So it is true. The ring of power. The doom of men. In a dream. I saw the eastern sky grow dark. but in the West a pale light lingered. Your doom is near at hand. Isildur's bane is found. Isildur\x19 s bane. Boromir! Ash nazg durbatul˚k. Ash nazg gimbatul. Ash nazg thrakatul˚k. agh burzumishi krimpatul. Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris. I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond. for the black speech of Mordor. may yet be heard. in every corner of the West! The ring is altogether evil. It is a gift. A gift to the foes of Mordor. Why not use this ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor. kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the blood of our people. are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy. Let us use it against him. You cannot wield it. None of us can. The one ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master. And what would a ranger know of this matter? This is no mere ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance. Aragorn. This is Isildur\x19 s heir? And heir to the throne of Gondor. Havo dad, Legolas. Gondor has no king. Gondor needs no king. Aragorn is right. We cannot use it. You have only one choice. The ring must be destroyed. What are we waiting for? The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin. by any craft that we here possess. The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. Only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor. and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. Ash Nazg Durbatuluk. One of you. must do this. One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep. The great eye is everwatchful. It is a barren wasteland. riddled with fire, and ash and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with 10,000 men could you do this. It is folly. Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The ring must be destroyed. And I suppose you think you are the one to do it! And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his? I will be dead before I see the ring in the hands of an elf! Never trust an elf! Do you not understand? While you bicker amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows! None can escape it! You'll all be destroyed! Ash Nazg Durbatuluk Ash nazg gimbatul. Ash Nazg Durbatuluk. Ash nazg gimbatul. Ash Nazg Durbatuluk. Ash nazg gimbatul. Ash Nazg Durbatuluk. I will take it. I will take it. I will take the ring to Mordor. Though. I do not know the way. I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins. as long as it is yours to bear. If by my life or death I can protect you. I will. You have my sword. And you have my bow. And my ax. You carry the fates of us all, little one. If this is indeed the will of the Council. then Gondor will see it done. Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me. No indeed it is hardly possible to separate you. even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not. Oy. We're coming too! You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us. Anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of. mission. Quest. Thing. Well, that rules you out, Pip. Nine companions. So be it. Great! Where are we going? Anirne hene beriad i chen lÓn. Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen. In her heart, your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life. That you'd never escape your fate. The skill of the elves can reforge the sword of kings. but only you have the power to wield it. I do not want that power. I have never wanted it. You are the last of that bloodline. There is no other. My old sword! Sting. Here, take it. Take it. It's so light. Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know. The blade glows blue when orcs are close. And it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful. Here's a pretty thing. Mithril. As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales. Let me see you put it on. Come on. My old ring. I should very much like. to hold it again, one last time. I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy. I'm sorry that you must carry this burden. I'm sorry for everything. The ringbearer is setting out on the quest of Mount Doom. On you who travel with him, no oath. nor bond is laid to go further than you will. Farewell. Hold to your purpose. May the blessings of elves and men. and all free folk go with you. The fellowship awaits the ringbearer. Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right? Left. We must hold to this course, west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days. If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us. From there, our road turns east to Mordor. Two, one, five. Good! Very good. Move your feet. You look good, Pippin. Thanks. Faster! If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they're not. I'd say we were taking the long way 'round. Gandalf. We could pass through the mines of Moria. My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome. No Gimli, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice. Sorry! Get him! For the Shire! Hold him. Hold him down, Merry! Gentlemen, that's enough. You've got my arm! You've got my arm! What is that? Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud. It's moving fast. Against the wind. Crebain from Dunland! Hide! Hurry! Take cover! Spies of Saruman. The passage south is being watched. We must take the pass of Caradhras. Frodo! Boromir. It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt. over so small a thing. Such a little thing. Boromir! Give the ring to Frodo. As you wish. I care not. So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails, where then will you go? If the mountain defeats you. will you risk a more dangerous road? Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse! There is a fell voice on the air. Nai yarvaxea rasselya! It's Saruman! He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf, we must turn back! No! Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i 'ruith! Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse! Nai yarvaxea rasselya. taltuva nottocarinnar! We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan, and take the west road to my city! The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard! We cannot pass over a mountain. Let us go under it. Let us go through the mines of Moria. Moria. You fear to go into those mines. The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep. You know what they awoke Shadow and flame. Let the ringbearer decide. We cannot stay here! This will be the death of the hobbits. Frodo? We will go through the mines. So be it. Frodo, come and help an old man. How is your shoulder? Better than it was. And the ring? You feel its power growing, don't you? I've felt it too. You must be careful now. Evil will be drawn to you from outside the fellowship. And, I fear, from within. Who then do I trust? You must trust yourself. Trust your own strengths. What do you mean? There are many powers in this world. for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am. And against some I have not yet been tested. The walls. of Moria. Dwarf doors are invisible when closed. Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten. Why doesn't that surprise me? Well, let's see. Ithildin. It mirrors only starlight and moonlight. It reads; The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter. What do you suppose that means? Oh It's quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open. Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen! lasto beth lammen. Nothing's happening. I once knew every spell in all the tongues of elves. men and orcs. What are you going to do, then? Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took! And if that does not shatter them. and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions. I will try to find the opening words. Ando Eldarinwa. a lasta quettanya. Fenda Casarinwa. Mines are no place for a pony. Even one so brave as Bill. Byebye, Bill. Fennas Nogothrim. Go on, Bill. Go on. Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home. Do not disturb the water. Oh, it's useless. It's a riddle. Speak 'friend' and enter. What's the elvish word for friend? Mellon. Soon, master elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves. Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone! This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin. And they call it a mine. A mine! This is no mine. It's a tomb. No.. No! Goblins. We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here. Now, get out of here. Get out! Frodo! Help! Strider! Help! Get off him! Aragorn! Frodo! Into the mines! Legolas! Into the cave! Run! We now have but one choice. We must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard. There are older and fouler things than orcs. in the deep places of the world. Quietly now. It's a fourday journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed. The wealth of Moria was not in gold. or jewels. but mithril. Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him. Oh, that was a kingly gift. Yes. I never told him. but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire. Pippin. I have no memory of this place. Are we Lost? No. I think we are. Gandalf's thinking. Merry? What? I'm hungry. There's something down there. It's Gollum. Gollum? He's been following us for three days. He escaped the dungeons of Baradd˚r? Escaped. or was set loose. Now the ring has brought him here. He will never be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the ring, as he hates and loves himseIf. Smeagol's life is a sad story. Yes, Smeagol he was once called. Before the ring found him. Before it drove him mad. It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance. Pity? It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill. before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many. I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In which case, you also were meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought. It's that way. He's remembered. No. But the air doesn't smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose. Let me risk a little more light. Behold. the great realm and dwarfcity of Dwarrowdelf. Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake. Gimli! No! Oh, no. No. Here lies Balin. son of Fundin. Lord of Moria. He is dead, then. It's as I feared. We must move on. We cannot linger. They have taken the bridge and the second hall. We have barred the gates. but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums. drums in the deep. We cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark. We cannot get out. They are coming. Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity. Frodo! Orcs. Get back! Stay close to Gandalf! They have a cavetroll. Let them come! There is one dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath. I think I'm getting the hang of this. Frodo! Aragorn! Aragorn! Frodo! Frodo! Oh, no. He's alive. I'm all right. I'm not hurt. You should be dead. That spear would have skewered a wild boar. I think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye. Mithril. You are full of surprises, Master Baggins. To the bridge of Khazadd˚m! This way! What is this new devilry? A Balrog. A demon of the ancient world. This foe is beyond any of you. Run! Quickly! Gandalf. Lead them on, Aragorn. The bridge is near. Do as I say! Swords are no more use here. Gandalf! Merry! Pippin! Sam! Nobody tosses a Dwarf. Not the beard! Steady. Hold on! Hang on! Lean forward! Steady. Come on! Now! Over the bridge! Fly! You cannot pass! Gandalf! I am a servant of the secret fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Ud˚n! Go back to the Shadow. YOU SHALL NOT PASS! No! No! Gandalf! Fly, you fools! No! Aragorn! Legolas, get them up. Give them a moment, for pity's sake! By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs. We must reach the woods of LothlÛrien. Come, Boromir. Legolas. Gimli, get them up. On your feet, Sam. Frodo? Frodo! Stay close, young hobbits! They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods. An elfwitch. of terrible power. All who look upon her. fall under her spell. Frodo! And are never seen again. Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom. You bring great evil here, ringbearer. Mr. Frodo? Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox. The dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark. Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion. Govannas vÓn gwennen le, Haldir o LÛrien. A, Aragorn in D˙nedain. istannen le ammen. Haldir. So much for the legendary courtesy of the elves! Speak words we can all understand! We have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days. And you know what this dwarf says to that? Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul! That was not so courteous. You bring great evil with you. You can go no further. Boe ammen veriad lÓn. Andelu i ven! Merin le telim. Henio, anÌron boe ammen i dulu lÓn! Aragorn! Merin le telim. Andelu i ven. Gandalf's death was not in vain. Nor would he have you give up hope. You carry a heavy burden, Frodo. Don't carry the weight of the dead. You will follow me. Cares Galeton. The heart of Elvendom on earth. Realm of the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light. The enemy knows you have entered here. What hope you had in secrecy is now gone. Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is Gandalf? For I much desire to speak with him. I can no longer see him from afar. Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land. He has fallen into shadow. He was taken by both shadow and flame. A Balrog of Morgoth. For we went needlessly into the net of Moria. Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. We do not yet know his full purpose. Do not let the great emptiness of Khazadd˚m fill your heart. Gimli, son of Gloin. For the world has grown full of peril. and in all lands. love is now mingled with grief. What now becomes of this fellowship? Without Gandalf, hope is lost. The quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail. to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while the company is true. Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest. for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. Tonight, you will sleep.. Welcome, Frodo of the Shire. one who has seen the eye! A lament for Gandalf. What do they say about him? I have not the heart to tell you. For me, the grief is still too near. I bet they don't mention his fireworks. There should be a verse about them. The finest rockets ever seen They burst in stars of blue and green Or after thunder, silver showers Came falling like a rain of flowers Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road. Take some rest. These borders are wellprotected. I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor. She said to me; Even now there is hope Left. But I cannot see it. It is long since we had any hope. My father is a noble man. But his rule is failing. and our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right, and I would do it. I would see the glory of Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it, Aragorn? The white tower of Ecthelion. Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver. Its banners caught high in the morning breeze. Have you ever been called home. by the clear ringing of silver trumpets? I have seen the white city. long ago. One day, our paths will lead us there. The Lords of Gondor have returned. Will you look into the mirror? What will I see? Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror. shows many things. Things that were. things that are. and some things. that have not yet come to pass. I know what it is you saw. For it is also in my mind. It is what will come to pass if you should fail. The fellowship is breaking. It is already begun. He will try to take the ring. You know of whom I speak. One by one, it will destroy them all. If you ask it of me. I will give you the one ring. You offer it to me freely. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this. In place of a dark lord, you would have a queen. not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Treacherous as the sea! Stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me. and despair. I pass the test. I will diminish. and go into the West. and remain Galadriel. I cannot do this alone. You are a ringbearer, Frodo. To bear a ring of power. is to be alone. This is Nenya, the ring of Adamant. And I am its keeper. This task was appointed to you. And if you do not find a way. no one will. Then I know what I must do. It's just. I'm afraid to do it. Even the smallest person can change the course of the future. Do you know how the orcs first came into being? They were elves once. Taken by the dark powers. tortured and mutilated. A ruined and terrible form of life. And now. perfected. My fighting Urukhai. whom do you serve? Saruman! Hunt them down. Do not stop until, they are found. You do not know pain. You do not know fear. You will taste manflesh! One of the halflings carries something of great value. Bring them to me alive and unspoiled. Kill the others. Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people. May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes. Lembas. Elvish waybread. One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man. How many did you eat? Four. Every league you travel south, the danger will increase. Mordor orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin. Nor will you find safety on the western bank. Strange creatures bearing the mark of the white hand have been seen on our borders. Seldom do orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so. Le aphadar aen. By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the falls of Rauros. My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim. Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin. These are the daggers of the Noldorin. They have already seen service in war. Do not fear, young Peregrin Took. You will find your courage. And for you, Samwise Gamgee. Elven rope made of hithlain. Thank you, my lady. Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers? And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves? Nothing. Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time. for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth. Actually.. There was one thing. No, no, I couIdn't. It's quite impossible. Stupid to ask. I have nothing greater to give. than the gift you already bear. Am meleth dÓn. I ant e guil Arwen UndÛmiel pÌgatha. AnÌron i e broniatha, ad ae periatham. athar i methid enamar hen. AnÌron i e cÌratha na Valannor. That choice is yet before her. You have your own choice to make, Aragorn. To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil. or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin. Nam·riÎ. Nadath n‚ i moe cerich. Dan, ˙'eveditham, Elessar. Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the light of Earendil. our most beloved star. May it be a light for you in dark places. when all other lights go out. I have taken my worst wound at this parting. having looked my last upon that which is fairest. Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me. What was her gift? I asked her for one hair from her golden head. She gave me three. Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria. I had hoped we would lose him on the river. But he's too clever a waterman. And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts. it will make the crossing even more dangerous. Have some food, Mr. Frodo. No, Sam. You haven't eaten anything all day. You're not sleeping, neither. Don't think I haven't noticed. Mr. Frodo I'm all right. But you're not. I'm here to help you. I promised Gandalf that I would. You can't help me, Sam. Not this time. Get some sleep. Minas Tirith is the safer road. You know that. From there we can regroup. Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength. There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us. You were quick enough to trust the elves. Have you so little faith in your own people? Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty. But there is courage also, and honor to be found in men. But you will not see that. You are afraid! All your life, you have hidden in the shadows. Scared of who you are, of what you are. I will not lead the ring within a hundred leagues of your city. Frodo. The Argonath. Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old. My kin. We cross the lake at nightfall. Hide the boats and continue on foot. We approach Mordor from the North. Oh, yes? Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil. an impassable labyrinth of razorsharp rocks. And after that, it gets even better. Festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see. That is our road. I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf. Recover my. We should Leave now. No. Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness. It is not the eastern shore that worries me. A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. Something draws near. I can feel it. Recover strength? Pay no heed to that, young hobbit. Where's Frodo? None of us should wander alone. You, least of all. So much depends on you. Frodo? I know why you seek solitude. You suffer. I see it day by day. You sure you do not suffer needlessly? There are other ways, Frodo. Other paths that we might take. I know what you would say. It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart. Warning.against what? We're all afraid, Frodo. But to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have. don't you see that is madness? There is no other way. I ask only for the strength to defend my people! If you would but lend me the ring. No. Why do you recoil? I am no thief. You are not yourself. What chance do you think you have? They will find you. They will take the ring. And you will beg for death before the end! You fool! It is not yours, save by unhappy chance! It could have been mine. It should be mine! Give it to me! Give it to me! No! Give it to me! No. I see your mind. You will take the ring to Sauron! You will betray us! You'll go to your death, and the death of us all! Curse you! Curse you and all the halflings! Frodo? Frodo. What have I done? Please, Frodo. Frodo, I'm sorry! Ash Ghur˚m Frodo? It has taken Boromir. Where is the ring? Stay away! Frodo! I swore to protect you. Can you protect me from yourself? Would you destroy it? Aragorn. Aragorn. Elessar. I would have gone with you to the end. Into the very fires of Mordor. I know. Look after the others. Especially Sam. He will not understand. Go, Frodo! Run. Run! Mr. Frodo! Find the halfling! Find the halfling! Elendil! Aragorn, go! Frodo! Hide here. Quick! Come on! What's he doing? He's leaving. No! Pippin! Run, Frodo. Go! Hey! Hey, you! Over here! Over here! This way! It's working! I know it's working! Run! The horn of Gondor. Boromir. Run! No. They took the little ones. Hold still. Frodo. Where is Frodo? I let Frodo go. Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the ring from him. The ring is beyond our reach now. Forgive me. I did not see it. I have failed you all. No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You have kept your honor. Leave it. It is over. The world of men will fall and all will come to darkness. and my city to ruin. I do not know what strength is in my blood. but I swear to you, I will not let the white city fall. nor our people fail. Our people. Our people. I would have followed you, my brother. My captain. My king. Be at peace. son of Gondor. They will look for his coming from the white tower. But he will not return. Frodo! I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened. So do all who live to see such times. but that is not for them to decide. All you have to decide. is what to do with the time that is given to you. Frodo, no! Frodo! Mr. Frodo! No, Sam. Go back, Sam! I'm going to Mordor alone. Of course you are. And I'm coming with you! You can't swim! Sam! Sam! I made a promise, Mr. Frodo. Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee. And I don't mean to. I don't mean to. Oh Sam. Come on. Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore. You mean not to follow them. Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands. Then it has all been in vain. The fellowship has failed. Not if we hold true to each other. We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death. Not while we have strength left. Leave all that can be spared behind. We travel light. Let us hunt some orc. Yes! Mordor. I hope the others find a safer road. Strider will look after them. I don't suppose we'll ever see them again. We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may. Sam. I'm glad you are with me. You cannot pass! Gandalf! I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. Go back to the Shadow. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun! You shall not pass! No! No! Gandalf! Fly, you fools. No! Gandalf! Gandalf! What is it, Mr. Frodo? Nothing. Just a dream. Can you see the bottom? No! Don't look down, Sam! Just keep going! Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo! Mr. Frodo! I think I've found the bottom. Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what. It's not natural. None of it. What's in this? Nothing. Just a bit of seasoning. I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something. Roast chicken?! You never know. Sam. My dear Sam. It's very special, that. It's the best salt in all the Shire. It is special. It's a little bit of home. We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down. Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo? It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that. Real Elvish rope. Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots. Won't come free in a hurry. Real Elvish rope. Mordor. The one place in Middleearth we don't want to see any closer. And it's the one place we're trying to get to. It's just where we can't get. Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost. I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way. He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam. but they did. Mr. Frodo? It's the Ring, isn't it? It's getting heavier. What food have we got left? Let me see. Oh, yes. Lovely. Lembas bread. And look! More lembas bread. I don't usually hold with foreign food. but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad. Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam? Those rain clouds might. This looks strangely familiar. It's because we've been here before. We're going in circles. What is that horrid stink? I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it? Yes. I can smell it. We're not alone. The thieves. The thieves. The filthy little thieves. Where is it? Where is it? They stole it from us. My precious. Curse them, we hates them! It's ours, it is, and we wants it! This is Sting. You've seen it before. haven't you, Gollum? Release him or I'll cut your throat. It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty Elves twisted it. Take it off us! Quiet, you! It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket. Let's just tie him up and leave him. No! That would kill us! Kill us! It's no more than you deserve! Maybe he does deserve to die. But now that I see him, I do pity him. We be nice to them if they be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears to do what you wants. We swears. There's no promise you can make that I can trust. We swears. to serve the master of the precious. We will swear on. on the precious. Gollum. Gollum. The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word. Yes. on the precious. On the precious. I don't believe you! Get down! I said, down! Sam! He's trying to trick us. If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep. You know the way to Mordor? Yes. You've been there before? Yes. You will lead us to the Black Gate. To the Gate, to the Gate! To the Gate, the master says. Yes! No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him. They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum! But we swore to serve the master of the precious. No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits. And Orcses, thousands of Orcses. And always the Great Eye watching, watching. Hey! Come back now! Come back! There! What did I tell you? He's run off, the old villain. So much for his promises. This way, Hobbits. Follow me! Merry! Merry! You're late. Our master grows impatient. He wants the Shirerats now. I don't take orders from Orcmaggots. Saruman will have his prize. We will deliver them. Merry! Merry? Wake up. My friend is sick. He needs water. Please! Sick, is he? Give him some medicine, boys! Stop it! Can't take his draught! Leave him alone! Why? You want some? Then keep your mouth shut. Merry. Hello, Pip. You're hurt. I'm fine. It was just an act. An act? See? I fooled you too. Don't worry about me, Pippin. What is it? What do you smell? Manflesh. They've picked up our trail. Aragorn. Let's move! Their pace has quickened. They must have caught our scent. Hurry! Come on, Gimli! Three days and nights pursuit. No food. No rest. And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell. Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall. They may yet be alive. Less than a day ahead of us. Come. Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them! I'm wasted on crosscountry. We Dwarves are natural sprinters. Very dangerous over short distances. Rohan. Home of the Horselords. There's something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures. Sets its will against us. Legolas! What do your Elfeyes see? The Uruks turn northeast. They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard. Saruman. The world is changing. Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard. and Mordor? To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman. and the union of the two towers? Together, my Lord Sauron. we shall rule this Middleearth. The Old World will burn in the fires of industry. The forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear. and the iron fists of the Orc. I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks! But, my lord, there are too many! They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means. Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day. We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires. The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep. Burn it. Yes. We will fight for you. Swear it. We will die for Saruman. The HorseMen took your lands. They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks. Murderers! Take back the lands they stole from you. Burn every village! We have only to remove those who oppose us. It will begin in Rohan. Too long have these peasants stood against you. But no more. Eothain! Eothain! You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two. Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf. He is too big for him. Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm. Do you understand me? Yes, Mama. I don't want to leave. I don't want to go, Mama. Freda, I will find you there. Quickly! Go, child. Rohan, my lord. is ready to fall. Theodred. Find the king's son! Mordor will pay for this. These Orcs are not from Mordor. My Lord Eomer, over here! He's alive. Theodred. Your son is badly wounded, my lord. He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force. That is a lie. Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally. Grima. Grima. Grima. Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will. Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman. Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind? Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent. your warmongering. Warmongering? How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Grima? When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure? Too long have you watched my sister. Too long have you haunted her steps. You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund. Too much. You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan. and all its domains under pain of death. You have no authority here. Your orders mean nothing. This order does not come from me. It comes from the king. He signed it this morning. Keep breathing. That's the key. Breathe. They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them. We're not going no further. until we've had a breather. Get a fire going! Merry! Merry! I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin. What's making that noise? It's the trees. What? You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland? Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall. and come alive. Alive? Trees that could whisper. talk to each other. even move. I'm starving. We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days. Yeah! Why can't we have some meat?! What about them? They're fresh. They are not for eating. What about their legs? They don't need those. They look tasty. Get back, scum! The prisoners go to Saruman. Alive and unspoiled. Alive? Why alive? Do they give good sport? They have something. An Elvish weapon. The master wants it for the war. They think we have the Ring. As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead. Just a mouthful. a bit of the flank. Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys. Pippin. Let's go. Go on. Call for help. Squeal. No one's going to save you now. Pippin! A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night. Riders of Rohan. what news from the Mark? What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly! Give me your name, horsemaster, and I shall give you mine. I would cut off your head, Dwarf. if it stood but a little higher from the ground. You would die before your stroke fell. I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm. We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king. Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe. Not even his own kin. Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king. and claimed lordship over these lands. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished. The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there, they say. as an old man hooded and cloaked. And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets. We are no spies. We track a party of Urukhai westward across the plain. They have taken two of our friends captive. The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night. But there were two Hobbits. Did you see two Hobbits with them? They would be small. Only children to your eyes. We left none alive. We piled the carcasses and burned them. Dead? I am sorry. Hasufel! Arod! May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters. Farewell. Look for your friends. But do not trust to hope. It has forsaken these lands. We ride north! It's one of their wee belts. Hiro hyn hîdh ab 'wanath. We failed them. A Hobbit lay here. And the other. They crawled. Their hands were bound. Their bonds were cut. They ran over here. They were followed. The belt! Run! Tracks lead away from the battle. into Fangorn Forest. Fangorn? What madness drove them in there? Did we lose him? I think we lost him. I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards! Come here! Trees. Climb a tree. He's gone. Merry! Let's put a maggot hole in your belly! Run, Merry! Little Orcs. It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking. Tree? I am no tree! I am an Ent. A treeherder. A shepherd of the forest. Don't talk to it, Merry. Don't encourage it! Treebeard, some call me. And whose side are you on? Side? I am on nobody's side. because nobody's on my side, little Orc. Nobody cares for the woods anymore. We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits! Hobbits? Never heard of a Hobbit before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me! They come with fire. They come with axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them! No! You don't understand. We're Hobbits! Halflings! Shirefolk! Maybe you are. and maybe you aren't. The White Wizard will know. The White Wizard? Saruman. See? See? We've led you out. Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry! Very lucky we find you. Nice Hobbit. It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp. A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist. Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly. I found it. I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go around for miles and miles. Come quickly. Soft and quick as shadows we must be. I hate this place. It's too quiet. There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days. No, no birdses to eat. No crunchable birdses. We are famished! Yes! Famished we are, precious! Here. What does it eats? Is it tasty? It tries to chokes us! We can't eats Hobbit food! We must starve! Well, starve, then. And good riddance! Oh, cruel Hobbit. It does not care if we be hungry. Does not care if we should die. Not like master. Master cares. Master knows. Yes. Precious. Once it takes hold of us. it never lets go. Don't touch me! There are dead things! Dead faces in the water. All dead. All rotten. Elves and Men and Orcses. A great battle long ago. Dead Marshes. Yes. Yes, that is their name. This way. Don't follow the lights. Careful now! Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones. and light little candles of their own. Frodo! Gollum? Don't follow the lights. Gollum! Mr. Frodo! Are you all right? So bright. So beautiful. Our precious. What did you say? Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength. Who are you? Mustn't ask us. Not its business. Gollum. Gollum. Gandalf told me you were one of the riverfolk. Cold be heart and hand and bone Cold be travelers far from home He said your life was a sad story. They do not see what lies ahead When sun has failed and moon is dead You were not so very different from a Hobbit once. Were you? Smeagol. What did you call me? That was your name once, wasn't it? A long time ago. My name. My name. Smeagol. Black Riders! Hide! Hide! Come on, Frodo. Come on! Quick! They will see us! They will see us! I thought they were dead. Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No. Wraiths! Wraiths on wings! They are calling for it. They are calling for the precious. Mr. Frodo! It's all right. I'm here. Hurry, Hobbits. The Black Gate is very close. Orc blood. These are strange tracks. The air is so close in here. This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory. and anger. The trees are speaking to each other. Gimli! Lower your ax. They have feelings, my friend. The Elves began it. Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak. Talking trees. What do trees have to talk about? Except the consistency of squirrel droppings. Aragorn, nad no ennas! Man cenich? The White Wizard approaches. Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us. We must be quick. You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits. Where are they? They passed this way the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you? Who are you? Show yourself! It cannot be. Forgive me. I mistook you for Saruman. I am Saruman. Or rather, Saruman as he should have been. You fell. Through fire. and water. From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak. I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth. Until at last I threw down my enemy. and smote his ruin upon the mountainside. Darkness took me. and I strayed out of thought and time. Stars wheeled overhead. and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again. I've been sent back. until my task is done. Gandalf. Gandalf? Yes. That was what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name. Gandalf. I am Gandalf the White. And I come back to you now. at the turn of the tide. One stage of your journey is over. Another begins. We must travel to Edoras with all speed. Edoras? That is no short distance! We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill with the king. Yes, and it will not be easily cured. Then we have run all this way for nothing? Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here. in this horrid, dark, dank treeinfested.? I mean, charming. quite charming forest. It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn. A great power has been sleeping here for many long years. The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones. that starts an avalanche in the mountains. I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend. You still speak in riddles. A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days. The Ents are going to wake up. and find that they are strong. Strong?! Oh, that's good. So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf. Merry and Pippin are quite safe. In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be. This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one. That is one of the Mearas. unless my eyes are cheated by some spell. Shadowfax. He is the lord of all horses. and has been my friend through many dangers. O rowan mine I saw you shine Upon a summer's day Upon your head How goldenred The crown you bore aloft Such a beautiful verse. Is it much further? Brurahroom. Don't be hasty. You might call it far, perhaps. My home lies deep in the forest. near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe. And safe is where I'll keep you. I believe you will enjoy this next one too. It's one of my own compositions. Right. Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves And the dreams of trees unfold When woodland halls are green and cool And the wind is in the West Come back to me Come back to me And say my land is best Sleep, little Shirelings. Heed no nightly noise. Sleep till morning light. I have business in the forest. There are many to call. Many that must come. The Shadow lies on Fangorn. The withering of all woods is drawing near. The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape. Sauron will suffer no rival. From the summit of Baraddur, his Eye watches ceaselessly. But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear. Doubt ever gnaws at him. The rumor has reached him. The heir of Numenor still lives. Sauron fears you, Aragorn. He fears what you may become. And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men. He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan. War is coming. Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge. for Rohan is weak and ready to fall. The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's. His hold over King Theoden is now very strong. Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose. But for all their cunning. we have one advantage. The Ring remains hidden. And that we should seek to destroy it. has not yet entered their darkest dreams. And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor. in the hands of a Hobbit. Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom. We must trust now in Frodo. Everything depends upon speed. and the secrecy of his quest. Do not regret your decision to leave him. Frodo must finish this task alone. He's not alone. Sam went with him. Did he? Did he, indeed? Good. Yes, very good. The Black Gate of Mordor. Oh, save us. My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now. Master says to show him the way into Mordor. So good Smeagol does, master says so. I did. That's it, then. We can't get past that. Look! The gate. It's opening! I can see a way down. Sam, no! Master! I do not ask you to come with me, Sam. I know, Mr. Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there. Now! No! No! No, master! They catch you! They catch you! Don't take it to him. He wants the precious. Always he is looking for it. And the precious is wanting to go back to him. But we mustn't let him have it. No! There's another way. More secret. A dark way. Why haven't you spoken of this before? Because master did not ask. He's up to something. Are you saying there's another way into Mordor? Yes. There's a path. and some stairs. And then. a tunnel. He's led us this far, Sam. Mr. Frodo, no. He's been true to his word. No. Lead the way, Smeagol. Good Smeagol always helps. Hello? Treebeard? Where has he gone? I had the loveliest dream last night. There was this large barrel, full of pipeweed. And we smoked all of it. And then. you were sick. I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby. Did you hear that? There it is again. Something's not right here. Not right at all. You just said something. Treeish. No, I didn't. I was just stretching. You're taller. Who? You! Than what? Than me! I've always been taller than you. Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one. You're the short one. Please, Merry. You're what? Threefootsix? At the most? Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7. 3'8! Threefooteight. You did something. Merry, don't! Don't drink it! Merry! No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any. I want some! It could well be dangerous! Give me it back. Merry! What's happening?! It's got my leg! Merry! Help! Away with you. You should not be waking. Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water. Go to sleep. Away with you. Come, the forest is waking up. It isn't safe. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. Black are their thoughts. Strong is their hate. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us Ents left to manage them. Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long? Are there Ent children? Brurahroom. There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years. Why is that? We lost the Entwives. Oh, I'm sorry. How did they die? Die? No. We lost them. And now we cannot find them. I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire? Can't say that I have. You, Pip? What do they look like? I don't remember now. Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan. whose mind is overthrown. Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong. My lord, your son. he is dead. My lord? Uncle? Will you not go to him? Will you do nothing? Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here. Oh, he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king. to lose his only son and heir. I understand. His passing is hard to accept. Especially now that your brother has deserted you. Leave me alone, snake! Oh, but you are alone. Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness. in the bitter watches of the night. when all your life seems to shrink. The walls of your bower closing in about you. A hutch to trammel some wild thing in. So fair. So cold. Like a morning of pale spring. still clinging to winter's chill. Your words are poison. You'll find more cheer in a graveyard. I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of Grima Wormtongue. Your staff. You would not part an old man from his walking stick. My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He's a herald of woe. The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late. Theoden King. He's not welcome. Why should I welcome you. Gandalf Stormcrow? A just question, my liege. Late is the hour. in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell I name him. Ill news is an ill guest. Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and death. to bandy crooked words with a witless worm. His staff. I told you to take the wizard's staff. Theoden. son of Thengel. too long have you sat in the Shadows. I would stay still if I were you. Hearken to me! I release you. from the spell. You have no power here. Gandalf the Grey. I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound. Wait. If I go, Theoden dies. You did not kill me. you will not kill him. Rohan is mine. Be gone. I know your face. Eowyn. Eowyn. Gandalf? Breathe the free air again, my friend. Dark have been my dreams of late. Your fingers would remember their old strength better. if they grasped your sword. I've only. ever served you, my lord. Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast! Send me not from your sight. No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been spilt on his account. Get out of my way! Hail, Theoden King! Where is Theodred? Where is my son? Bealocwealm hafað fréone frecan forth onsended. giedd sculon singan gléomenn sorgiende. On Meduselde. þæt he ma no wære. is þurh niedig rest. And mægen deorost. bealo. Simbelmyn? Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers. Now it shall cover the grave of my son. Alas that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live. to see the last days of my house. Theodred's death was not of your making. No parent should have to bury their child. He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers. Westu hál. Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu. They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree. Where is Mama? This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. You must fight. You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king. They will be 300 leagues from here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I know what it is you want of me. but I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war. Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not. When last I looked. Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan. Then what is the king's decision? By order of the king. the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep. Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you need. Helm's Deep. They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king? He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm's Deep has saved them in the past. There is no way out of that ravine. Theoden is walking into a trap. He thinks he's leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre. Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defenses have to hold. They will hold. The Grey Pilgrim. That's what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in vain. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the east. Go. That horse is half mad, my lord. There's nothing you can do. Leave him. Fæste. stille nú. Fæste. Stille. stille. stille. stille. Lac is drefed, gefrægon. Hwæt nemnað ðe? Hwæt nemnað ðe? His name is Brego. He was my cousin's horse. Brego. Ðin nama is cynglic. Man le trasta, Brego? Man cenich? I have heard of the magic of Elves. but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North. You speak as one of their own. I was raised in Rivendell. for a time. Turn this fellow free. He's seen enough of war. Gandalf the White. Gandalf the Fool! Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety? There were three who followed the wizard. An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man. You stink of horse. The Man. was he from Gondor? No, from the North. One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was. His cloth was poor. And yet he bore a strange ring. Two serpents with emerald eyes. One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers. The Ring of Barahir. So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir. The lost king of Gondor. He is a fool. The line was broken years ago. It matters not. The world of Men shall fall. It will begin at Edoras. I am ready, Gamling. Bring my horse. This is not a defeat. We will return. We will return. You have some skill with a blade. Those without swords can still die upon them. I fear neither death nor pain. What do you fear, my lady? A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them. And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire. You're a daughter of kings. a shield maiden of Rohan. I do not think that would be your fate. Theoden will not stay at Edoras. It's vulnerable. He knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They will flee to Helm's Deep. the great fortress of Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains. They will be slow. They will have women and children with them. Send out your Wargriders. Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead. Why do you do that? What? Call him names. Run him down all the time. Because. Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in him but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about. You have no idea what it did to him. what it's still doing to him. I want to help him, Sam. Why? Because I have to believe he can come back. You can't save him, Mr. Frodo. What do you know about it? Nothing! I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that. I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it. I know what I have to do, Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task. Mine! My own! Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know who you sound like? We wants it. We needs it. Must have the precious. They stole it from us. Sneaky little Hobbitses. Wicked. Tricksy. False. No. Not master. Yes, precious. False. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie! Master's my friend. You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you. Not listening. I'm not listening. You're a liar and a thief. No. Murderer. Go away. Go away? I hate you. I hate you. Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum. I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me. Not anymore. What did you say? Master looks after us now. We don't need you. What? Leave now. and never come back. No. Leave now and never come back. Leave now and never come back! We told him to go away. And away he goes, precious. Gone! Gone! Gone! Smeagol is free! Look. Look. See what Smeagol finds? They are young. They are tender. They are nice. Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them! You'll make him sick, you will. behaving like that. There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys. What's it doing? Stupid, fat Hobbit. It ruins it. What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them. What we need is a few good taters. What's taters, precious? What's taters? Eh? Potatoes. Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew. Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish. Even you couldn't say no to that. Oh, yes, we could. Spoil a nice fish. Give it to us raw. and wriggling. You keep nasty chips. You're hopeless. Mr. Frodo? Who are they? Wicked Men. Servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armies to him. It won't be long now. He will soon be ready. Ready to do what? To make his war. The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow. We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam. Mr. Frodo. Look. It's an oliphaunt. No one at home will believe this. Smeagol? We've lingered here too long. Come on, Sam. Wait! We're innocent travelers! There are no travelers in this land. Only servants of the Dark Tower. We are bound to an errand of secrecy. Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us. The enemy? His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem. You wonder what his name is. where he came from. And if he was really evil at heart. What lies or threats led him on this long march from home. If he would not rather have stayed there. in peace. War will make corpses of us all. Bind their hands. It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance. that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men. It's the beards. This, in turn, has given rise to the belief. that there are no Dwarf women. and that Dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground. which is, of course, ridiculous. It's all right. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate. I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time. She was a girl when they brought her father back dead. Cut down by Orcs. She watched her mother succumb to grief. Then she was left alone, to tend her king in growing fear. Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father. Gimli. No, I couldn't I really couldn't. I made some stew. It isn't much, but it's hot. Thank you. It's good. Really? My uncle told me a strange thing. He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather. But he must be mistaken. King Theoden has a good memory. He was only a small child at the time. Then you must be at least 60. Seventy? But you cannot be 80! Eightyseven. You are one of the Dunedain. A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life. It was said that your race had passed into legend. There are few of us left. The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago. I'm sorry. Please, eat. The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane. It is mine to give to whom I will. Like my heart. Go to sleep. I am asleep. This is a dream. Then it is a good dream. Sleep. Minlû pedich nin. i aur hen telitha. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han bâd lîn. Dolen i vâd o nin. Si peliannen i vâd na dail lîn. Si boe údhannathach. Arwen.

Let her bear away her love for you to the Undying Lands. There it will be ever green. But never more than memory. I will not leave my daughter here to die. She stays because she still has hope. She stays for you. She belongs with her people. SharePirate.Com Subs Nach gwannatha sin? Ma nathach hi gwannathachor think you could slip away Úethelithon. Estelio guru lîn ne dagor. Ethelithach.

What is it? What do you see? Warg! We're under attack! Get them out of here! All riders to the head of the column. Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider. Come on! You must lead the people to Helm's Deep, and make haste. I can fight. No! You must do this, for me. Follow me! Forward. I mean, charge forward. Make for the lower ground! That's it! Go on! Stay together! Bring your pretty face to my ax. That one counts as mine! Stinking creature. Aragorn! Aragorn? Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing. He's. dead. He took a little tumble off the cliff. You lie. Get the wounded on horses. The wolves of Isengard will return. Leave the dead. Come. At last! Helm's Deep. There it is, Helm's Deep. We're safe! We're safe, my lady. Thank you. Mama! Eothain! Freda! Where is the rest? This is all we could save, my lady. Take it to the caves. Make way for the king. Make way for Theoden. Make way for the king. So few. So few of you have returned. Our people are safe. We have paid for it with many lives. My lady. Lord Aragorn. where is he? He fell. Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar the gate. And set a watch on the surround. What of those who cannot fight, my lord? The women and children? Get them into the caves. Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here. Helm's Deep has one weakness. Its outer wall is solid rock. but for a small culvert at its base. which is little more than a drain. How? How can fire undo stone? What kind of device could bring down the wall? If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall. Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning. thousands, to storm the Keep. Tens of thousands. But, my lord, there is no such force. A new power is rising. Its victory is at hand. This night. the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helm's Deep! Leave none alive! To war! There will be no dawn for Men. Look. There's smoke to the south. There is always smoke rising. from Isengard these days. Isengard? There was a time. when Saruman would walk in my woods. But now he has a mind of metal. and wheels. He no longer cares for growing things. What is it? It's Saruman's army. The war has started. May the grace of the Valar protect you. Brego. Arwen. Tollen i lû. I chair gwannar na Valannor. are leaving for Valinor. Go I have made my choice. He is not coming back. Why do you linger here when there is no hope? There is still hope. If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted. If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king. and all that you hope for comes true. you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality. Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time. Aragorn will die. And there will be no comfort for you. no comfort to ease the pain of his passing. He will come to death. an image of the splendor of the kings of Men. in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world. But you, my daughter. you will linger on in darkness and in doubt. as nightfall in winter that comes without a star. Here you will dwell. bound to your grief under the fading trees. until all the world is changed. and the long years of your life are utterly spent. Arwen. There is nothing for you here. only death. A im ú'erin veleth lîn? Gerich meleth nîn, ada. I amar prestar aen. Han mathon ne nen. Han mathon ne chae, a han noston ned 'wilith. The power of the enemy is growing. Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman. to destroy the people of Rohan. Isengard has been unleashed. The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor. the last free kingdom of Men. His war on this country will come swiftly. He senses the Ring is close. The strength of the Ringbearer is failing. In his heart, Frodo begins to understand. the quest will claim his life. You know this. You have foreseen it. It is the risk we all took. In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong. It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of Men. Men, who are so easily seduced by its power. The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand. take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall. It is close now. So close to achieving its goal. For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth. even unto to the ending of the world. The time of the Elves. is over. Do we leave Middleearth to its fate? Do we let them stand alone? What news? Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep. But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshaling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate. How many? Some thousands. More come every day. Who's covering the river to the north? We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath. If their city is attacked, we won't hold it. Saruman attacks from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to Men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him. My men tell me that you are Orc spies. Spies? Now wait just a minute. Well, if you're not spies, then who are you? Speak. We are Hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee. Your bodyguard? His gardener. And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an illfavored look. There was no other. We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Moria. two were my kin. a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men. Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor. You're a friend of Boromir? Yes. For my part. It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead. Dead? How? When? As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me. If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us. His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past. It was cloven in two. But more than this, I know it in my heart. He was my brother. Boromir! Boromir! This city was once the jewel of our kingdom. A place of light and beauty and music. And so it shall be once more! Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands. This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor! For Gondor! For Gondor! For Gondor! For Gondor! Good speech. Nice and short. Leaves more time for drinking! Break out the ale! These men are thirsty! Remember today, little brother. Today, life is good. What? He's here. One moment of peace, can he not give us that? Where is he? Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my firstborn? Father! They say you vanquished the enemy almost singlehandedly. They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also. But for Faramir, this city would still be standing. Were you not entrusted to protect it? I would have done, but our numbers were too few. Oh, too few. You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim. Always you cast a poor reflection on me. That is not my intent. You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will. He loves you, Father. Do not trouble me with Faramir. I know his uses, and they are few. We have more urgent things to speak of. Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting. He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose. It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found. The One Ring. Isildur's Bane. It has fallen into the hands of the Elves. Everyone will try to claim We cannot let that happen. This thing must come to Gondor. Gondor. It's dangerous, I know. Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men. But you, you are strong. And our need is great. It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying. Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies. He will return. And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him. You must go. Bring me back this mighty gift. No. My place is here with my people. Not in Rivendell. Would you deny your own father? If there is need to go to Rivendell. send me in his stead. You? Oh, I see. A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality. I think not. I trust this mission only to your brother. The one who will not fail me. Remember today, little brother. Captain Faramir! We found the third one. You must come with me. Now. Down there. To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death. They wait for my command. Shall I shoot? The rock and pool Is nice and cool So juicy sweet Our only wish To catch a fish So juicy sweet Wait. This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide. Please. let me go down to him. Smeagol. Master is here. Come, Smeagol. Trust master. Come. We must go now? Smeagol, you must trust master. Follow me. Come on. Come. Come, Smeagol. Nice Smeagol. That's it. Come on. Don't hurt him! Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen to me. Master! Why does it cry, Smeagol? Cruel Men hurts us. Master tricksed us. Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false. Master is our friend. Our friend. Master betrayed us. No. Not its business. Leave us alone! Filthy little Hobbitses! They stole it from us! No. No. What did they steal? My precious! We have to get out of here. You go. Go, now. You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear. I can't. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me but. I'm sorry. The Ring's taking me, Sam. If I put it on. he'll find me. He'll see. Mr. Frodo. So this is the answer to all the riddles. Here in the Wild I have you. two Halflings. and a host of men at my call. The Ring of Power within my grasp. A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor. to show his quality. No! Stop it! Leave him alone. Don't you understand? He's got to destroy it! That's where we're going, into Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire! Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements. Please. It's such a burden. Will you not help him? Captain? Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to Gondor. Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn. He's alive! Where is he? Where is he? Get out of the way! I'm going to kill him! You are the luckiest, the canniest. and the most reckless man I ever knew. Bless you, laddie. Gimli, where is the king? Le abdollen. You look terrible. Hannon le. A great host, you say? All Isengard is emptied. How many? Ten thousand strong at least. Ten thousand? To destroy the world of Men. They will be here by nightfall. Let them come! I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms. to be ready for battle by nightfall. We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall. or set foot inside the Hornburg! This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Urukhai. Their armor is thick and their shields broad. I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep. They will break upon this fortress like water on rock. Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn. We've seen it before. Crops can be resown. homes rebuilt. Within these walls. we will outlast them. They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages. They come to destroy its people. down to the last child. What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end. as to be worthy of remembrance. Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid. And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead. Gondor will answer. Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?! Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?! Where was Gon.? No, my Lord Aragorn. we are alone. Get the women and children into the caves. We need more time to lay provisions. There is no time. War is upon us. Secure the gate. We Ents have not troubled. about the wars of Men and wizards. for a very long time. But now, something is about to happen. that has not happened. for an age. Entmoot. What's that? 'Tis a gathering. A gathering of what? Beech. Oak. Chestnut. Ash. Good. Good. Good. Many have come. Now we must decide if the Ents. will go to war. Move back! Move to the caves! Come on, people! Quickly, now! We'll place the reserves along the wall. They can support the archers from above the gate. Aragorn, you must rest. You're no use to us half alive. Aragorn! I'm to be sent with the women into the caves. That is an honorable charge. To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return. What renown is there in that? My lady, a time may come for valor without renown. Who then will your people look to in the last defense? Let me stand at your side. It is not in my power to command it. You do not command the others to stay! They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you. Because they love you. I'm sorry. Farmers, farriers, stable boys. These are no soldiers. Most have seen too many winters. Or too few. Look at them. They're frightened. I can see it in their eyes. Boe a hyn Neled herain. dan caer menig Si beriathar hyn ammaeg na ned Edoras. hope of defending themselves Aragorn nedin dagor hen ú'erir ortheri. Natha daged dhaer. Then I shall die as one of them! Let him go, lad. Let him be. Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory. My lord? Who am I, Gamling? You are our king, sire. And do you trust your king? Your men, my lord. will follow you to whatever end. To whatever end. Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the West. behind the hills. into Shadow. How did it come to this? It's been going for hours. They must have decided something by now. Decided? No. We only just finished saying. good morning. But it's nighttime already. You can't take forever. Don't be hasty. We're running out of time! Move! Move to the outer wall. Give me your sword. What is your name? Haleth, son of Hama, my lord. The men are saying we will not live out the night. They say that it is hopeless. This is a good sword. Haleth, son of Hama. there is always hope. We have trusted you this far. You have not led us astray. Forgive me. I was wrong to despair. Úmoe edhored, Legolas. We had time, I'd get this adjusted. It's a little tight across the chest. That is no Orc horn. Send for the king. Open the gate! Open up the gate! How is this possible? I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. An alliance once existed between Elves and Men. Long ago we fought and died together. We come to honor that allegiance. Mae govannen, Haldir! You are most welcome. We are proud to fight alongside Men once more. You could have picked a better spot. Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night. Your friends are with you, Aragorn. Let's hope they last the night. A Eruchîn. údano i faelas a hyn. an uben tanatha le faelas. What's happening out there? Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box? Dartho! So it begins. Tangado a chadad! Faeg ivarv. dîn na lanc. a nu ranc. Leithio i philinn! Did they hit anything? Give them a volley. Fire! Fire! Send them to me! Come on! Pendraith! Good! Swords! Swords! Legolas! Two already! I'm on 17! I'll have no pointyear outscoring me! Nineteen! Merry. We have just agreed. Yes? I have told your names to the Entmoot. and we have agreed. you are not Orcs. Well, that's good news. And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about him? Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc. Hasty? Our friends are out there. They need our help. They cannot fight this war on their own. War? Yes. It affects us all. Tree, root and twig. But you must understand, young Hobbit. it takes a long time. to say anything in Old Entish. and we never say anything. unless it is worth taking. a long time to say. Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty! Twentyone! Causeway! Towards the causeway! Is this it? Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman? Togo han dad, Legolas! Dago hon! Dago hon! Brace the gate! Hold them! Stand firm! Aragorn! Gimli! Hado i philinn! Herio! The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done. How can that be your decision?! This is not our war. But you're part of this world! Aren't you?! You must help. Please. You must do something. You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home. Maybe Treebeard's right. We don't belong here, Merry. It's too big for us. What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home. The fires of Isengard will spread. and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn. And. And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. There won't be a Shire, Pippin. Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there! Am Marad! Nan Barad! Haldir! Nan Barad! What are you doing? What are you stopping for? Nan Barad! Haldir! Brace the gate! Hold them! To the gate. Draw your swords! Make way! We cannot hold much longer! Hold them! How long do you need? As long as you can give me. Gimli! Timbers! Brace the gate! Come on. We can take them. It's a long way. Toss me. What? I cannot jump the distance! You'll have to toss me! Don't tell the Elf. Not a word. Shore up the door! Make way! Follow me to the barricade. Watch our backs! Throw another one over here! Higher! Hold fast the gate! Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there! Aragorn! Pull everybody back. Pull them back. Fall back! Fall back! They have broken through! The castle is breached. Retreat! Fall back! Retreat! Hurry! Inside. Get them inside! Into the Keep! I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from there. Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take us south. South? But that will lead you past Isengard. Yes. Exactly. If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. It's the last thing he'll expect. That doesn't make sense to me. But then. you are very small. Perhaps you're right. South it is, then. Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going downhill. Are you mad? We'll be caught. No, we won't. Not this time. Look! Osgiliath burns! Mordor has come. The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only the power to destroy. Please. let me go. Hurry. Faramir! You must let me go! And those little family of field mice. that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully. They're always trying to get somewhere where they. Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn. I'm sorry, Treebeard. They had voices of their own. Saruman. A wizard should know better! There is no curse in Elvish. Entish or the tongues of Men. for this treachery. Look! The trees! They're moving! Where are they going? They have business with the Orcs. My business is with Isengard tonight. with rock and stone. Yes. Come, my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely. that we go to our doom. Last march. of the Ents. Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great. By nightfall we will be overrun. Mr. Frodo? It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me. Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right. Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war. Do you want to know what happened to Boromir? You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! He tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad! Watch out! Mr. Frodo? They're here. They've come. Nazgul! Stay here. Keep out of sight. Take cover! The fortress is taken. It is over. You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it. They still defend it. They have died defending it. They're breaking in! They're past the door! Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves? Is there no other way? There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far. The Urukhai are too many. Tell the women and children to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance! So much death. What can Men do against such reckless hate? Ride out with me. Ride out and meet them. For death and glory. For Rohan. For your people. The sun is rising. Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn. look to the east. Yes. Yes. The horn of Helm Hammerhand. shall sound in the Deep. one last time. Yes! Let this be the hour when we draw swords together. Fell deeds, awake. Now for wrath. now for ruin and a red dawn. Forth Eorlingas! Gandalf. Theoden King stands alone. Not alone. Rohirrim! Eomer. To the king! Yes! A hit. A fine hit. Break the dam! Release the river! Pippin! Hold on! Hold on, little Hobbits. What are you doing? Where are you going? It's me. It's your Sam. Don't you know your Sam? I can't do this, Sam. I know. It's all wrong. By rights, we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was. when so much bad had happened? Victory! We have victory! But in the end, it's only a passing thing. this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. that meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories. had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. They kept going. because they were holding on to something. What are we holding on to, Sam? That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for. I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins. You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. If you let them go, your life will be forfeit. Then it is forfeit. Release them. Stay out of the forest! Keep away from the trees! Final count. 42. 42? That's not bad for a pointyeared Elvish princeling. I myself am sitting pretty on 43. 43. He was already dead. He was twitching. He was twitching. because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system! He doesn't look too happy, does he? Not too happy at all, Merry. Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there. Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment. I hear the staff are very good. What are you doing? Nothing. The world's back to normal, that's all. No, it isn't. I'm starving. Good luck trying to find something decent around here. Probably dead rats and moldy bread. Saruman's storeroom! I don't believe it. It can't be. It is! Longbottom Leaf. The finest pipeweed in South Farthing. It's perfect. One barrel each. Wait. Do you think we should share it with Treebeard? Share it? No. No. Dead plant and all that. Don't think he'd understand. Could be a distant relative. I get it. Don't be hasty. Exactly. Barhrum. This is the old sewer. Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city. You'll find cover in the woods there. Captain Faramir. you have shown your quality, sir. The very highest. The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee. where gardeners are held in high honor. What road will you take once you reach the woods? Gollum says there's a path. near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains. Cirith Ungol? Is that its name? No. No! Yes. Frodo. they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul. You cannot go that way. It is the only way. Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try. I must. Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men. Thank you. May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm. Come on, keep up. Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you. You know that, don't you? He was trying to save you, see? Save me? So there's no hard feelings. Forgive and forget. No, no, no hard feelings. Gollum, Gollum. Yes, master. Nice Hobbits. Very decent of you. Very decent, indeed, Gollum. Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift. The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middleearth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits. somewhere in the wilderness. I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales. What? I wonder if people will ever say, Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring. And they'll say, Yes! That's one of my favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad? Yes, my boy. The most famousest of Hobbits. And that's saying a lot. Well, you've left out one Samwise the Brave. I want to hear more about Sam. Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam. Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious. So was I. Samwise the Brave. Smeagol? We're not going to wait for you. Come on. Master. Master looks after us. Master wouldn't hurt us. Master broke his promise. Don't ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol. Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy. False. We ought to wring his filthy little neck. Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both! And then we take the precious. and we be the master! But the fat Hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching. Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses and make him crawl. Yes. Yes. Yes. Kill them both. Yes. No! No! It's too risky. It's too risky. Where is he? Where has he gone? Hey, Gollum! Where are you? Smeagol? We could let her do it. Yes. She could do it. Yes, precious, she could. And then we takes it once they're dead. Once they're dead. Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet. Smeagol will show you the way. Follow me. I've got one! I've got a fish, Smeag. Smeagol! Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in. Deagol! Deagol? Deagol. Give us that, Deagol, my love. Why? Because. it's my birthday and I wants it. My precious. They cursed us. Murderer. Murderer they called us. They cursed us and drove us away. Gollum. Gollum. Gollum. And we wept, precious. We wept to be so alone. and cool So nice for feet And we only wish To catch a fish So juicy sweet And we forgot the taste of bread. the sound of trees. the softness of the wind. We even forgot our own name. My precious. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies. We must go, yes. We must go at once. Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo? I've gone and had too much. Must be getting late. No. It isn't. It isn't midday yet. The days are growing darker. Come on! Must go! No time! Not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat. No time to lose, silly. Here. What about you? Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Leastways, not for lembas bread. Sam. All right. We don't have that much left. We have to be careful or we're going to run out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo. I've rationed it. There should be enough. For what? The journey home. Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry. It's good. Definitely from the Shire. Longbottom Leaf. I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon. Green Dragon. A mug of ale in my hand. Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day's work. Only, you've never done a hard day's work. Welcome, my lords. to Isengard! You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on. and now we find you feasting and. and smoking! We are sitting on a field of victory. enjoying a few wellearned comforts. The salted pork is particularly good. Salted pork? Hobbits. We're under orders from Treebeard. who's taken over management of Isengard. Young Master Gandalf. I'm glad you've come. Wood and water, stock and stone I can master. But there is a wizard to manage here. locked in his tower. Show yourself. Be careful. Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous. Well, let's just have his head and be done with it. No. We need him alive. We need him to talk. You have fought many wars and slain many men, Theoden King. and made peace afterwards. Can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend? Can we not have peace, you and I? We shall have peace. We shall have peace. when you answer for the burning of the Westfold. and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers. whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead. against the gates of the Hornburg, are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows. we shall have peace. Gibbets and crows? Dotard! What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame? Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc. Or perhaps the Keys of Baraddur itself. along with the crowns of the seven kings and the rods of the Five Wizards! Your treachery has already cost many lives. Thousands more are now at risk. But you could save them, Saruman. You were deep in the enemy's counsel. So you have come here for information. I have some for you. Something festers in the heart of Middleearth. Something that you have failed to see. But the Great Eye has seen it. Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon. You're all going to die. But you know this, don't you, Gandalf? You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows, will never be crowned king. Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those closest to him. those he professes to love. Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling. before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death. I've heard enough! Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob. No. Come down, Saruman. and your life will be spared. Save your pity and your mercy. I have no use for it! Saruman. your staff is broken. Grima, you need not follow him. You were not always as you are now. You were once a Man of Rohan. Come down. A Man of Rohan? What is the house of Rohan. but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek. and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? The victory at Helm's Deep does not belong to you, Theoden Horsemaster. You are a lesser son of greater sires. Grima. come down. Be free of him. Free? He will never be free. No. Get down, cur! Saruman! You were deep in the enemy's counsel. Tell us what you know! You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you where your doom will be decided. I will not be held prisoner here. Send word to all our allies. and to every corner of Middleearth that still stands free. The enemy moves against us. We need to know where he will strike. The filth of Saruman. is washing away. Trees will come back to live here. Young trees. Wild trees. Pippin! Bless my bark! Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad. Quickly, now. Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. Hail the victorious dead. Hail! No pauses. No spills. And no regurgitation. So it's a drinking game? Last one standing wins. What'll we drink to? Let's drink to victory! To victory! Be thou, Aragorn, well. I am happy for you. He is an honorable man. You are both honorable men. It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory. Don't listen to me. You are young. And tonight is for you. Here, here. It's the Dwarves that go swimming with little, hairy women. I feel something. A slight tingle in my fingers. I think it's affecting me. What did I say? He can't hold his liquor. Game over. Oh, you can search far and wide You can drink the whole town dry But you'll never find a beer so brown But you'll never find a beer so brown As the one we drink in our hometown As the one we drink in our hometown You can drink your fancy ales You can drink them by the flagon But the only brew for the brave and true Pippin! But the only brew for the brave and true Comes from The Green Dragon Thank you! I win! No news of Frodo? No word. Nothing. We have time. Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor. Do we know that? What does your heart tell you? That Frodo is alive. Yes. Yes, he's alive. Too risky. Too risky. Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both. Quiet! Mustn't wake them. Mustn't ruin it now. But they knows. They knows. They suspects us. What's it saying, my precious, my love? Is Smeagol losing his nerve? No. Not. Never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Smeagol wants to see them dead. And we will. Smeagol did it once. He can do it again. It's ours! Ours! We must get the precious. We must get it back. Patience! Patience, my love. First we must lead them to her. We lead them to the Winding Stair. Yes, the stairs. And then? Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go. until we come to the tunnel. And when they go in. there's no coming out. She's always hungry. She always needs to feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses. And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious? No. Not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats. Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes. then we will find it. And take it for me! For us. Yes. We meant for us. Gollum. Gollum. The precious will be ours. once the Hobbitses are dead! You treacherous little toad! No! No! Master! No, Sam! Leave him alone! I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us. Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly. He's a horrid, fat Hobbit. who hates Smeagol. and who makes up nasty lies. You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in! Sam! Call me a liar? You're a liar! You scare him off, we're lost! I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo. I won't wait around for him to kill us! I'm not sending him away. You don't see it, do you? He's a villain. We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side. I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo. I know, Sam. I know. Trust me. Come, Smeagol. What time is it? Not yet dawn. I dreamed I saw a great wave. climbing over green lands and above the hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet. A light shone behind me. but I could not turn. I could only stand there, waiting. Night changes many thoughts. Sleep, Eowyn. Sleep. while you can. The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the east. A sleepless malice. The Eye of the enemy is moving. What are you doing? Pippin! Pippin? Pippin. What, are you mad? I just want to look at it. Just one more time. Put it back. Pippin. No! Pippin. He is here. I see you. Pippin! Help! Gandalf, help! Someone help him! Pippin! Fool of a Took! Look at me. Gandalf, forgive me. Look at me. What did you see? A tree. There was a white tree. in a courtyard of stone. It was dead. The city was burning. Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw? I saw. I saw him. I could hear his voice in my head. And what did you tell him? Speak! He asked me my name. I didn't answer. He hurt me. What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring? There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool. but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing. He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still, strength enough perhaps to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middleearth uniting under one banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground. before he sees a king return to the throne of Men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war. Tell me. why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? What do we owe Gondor? I will go. No! They must be warned. They will be. You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the black ships. Things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for Minas Tirith. and I won't be going alone. Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst. Hurry! Hurry! Where are we going? Why did you look? Why do you always have to look? I don't know. I can't help it. You never can. I'm sorry, all right? I won't do it again. Don't you understand? The enemy thinks you have the Ring. He's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here. And you.? You're coming with me? Merry? Come on. How far is Minas Tirith? Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies. And you better hope we don't have one of those on our tail. Here. Something for the road. The last of the Longbottom Leaf. I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin. But. But we'll see each other soon. Won't we? I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen. Merry. Run, Shadowfax. Show us the meaning of haste. Merry! Merry! He's always followed me. everywhere I went. since before we were tweens. I would get him into the worst sort of trouble. but I was always there to get him out. Now he's gone. Just like Frodo and Sam. They're a most hardy folk. Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took. Take her by the safest road. A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to carry her across the sea. The last journey of Arwen Undomiel. There is nothing for you here. only death. Lady Arwen. we cannot delay. My lady! Tell me what you have seen. Arwen. You have the gift of foresight. What did you see? I looked into your future, and I saw death. But there is also life. You saw there was a child. You saw my son. That future is almost gone. But it is not lost. Nothing is certain. Some things are certain. If I leave him now. I will regret it forever. It is time. From the ashes a fire shall be woken A light from the shadow shall spring Renewed shall be blade that was broken The crownless again shall be king Reforge the sword. Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you. This was my choice. Whether by your will or not. there is no ship now that can bear me hence. We've just passed into the realm of Gondor. Minas Tirith. City of kings. Make way! It's the tree. Gandalf. Gandalf. Yes, the White Tree of Gondor. The tree of the king. Lord Denethor, however, is not king. He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne. Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father. To give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise. And do not mention Frodo or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Peregrin Took. Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion, lord and steward of Gondor. I come with tidings in this dark hour, and with counsel. Perhaps you come to explain this. Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead. Boromir died to save us. my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from many foes. Pippin. I offer you my service, such as it is. in payment of this debt. This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not. so mighty a man as he was? The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow. and Boromir was pierced by many. Get up. My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir. but it is not now. War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged. with the defense of this city. Where are Gondor's armies? You still have friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons. You think you are wise, Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor. And with your right you'd seek to supplant me. I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn. And I tell you now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the North. last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship. Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king, steward. The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's. Come. All has turned to vain ambition. He would even use his grief as a cloak. A thousand years this city has stood. Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall. And the White Tree, the tree of the king. will never bloom again. Why are they still guarding it? They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once was. before it fell into decay. The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living. and counted the old names of their descent. dearer than the names of their sons. Childless lords sat in aged halls, musing on heraldry. or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin. The line of kings failed. The White Tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men. Mordor. Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow. A storm is coming. This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron's making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight. so he covers the face of the sun. to ease their passage along the road to war. When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city. it will begin. Well. Minas Tirith. very impressive. So where are we off to next? Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin. There's no leaving this city. Help must come to us. It must be getting near teatime. Leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime. We're not in decent places. Mr. Frodo? What is it? It's just a feeling. I don't think I'll be coming back. Yes, you will. Of course you will. That's just morbid thinking. We're going there and back again. just like Mr. Bilbo. You'll see. I think these lands were once part of the kingdom of Gondor. Long ago, when there was a king. Mr. Frodo, look. The king has got a crown again. Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way. So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position. I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting. Do they? You're in the service of the steward now. You'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took. Ridiculous Hobbit. Guard of the Citadel. Thank you. There's no more stars. Is it time? Yes. It's so quiet. It's the deep breath before the plunge. I don't want to be in a battle. but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse. Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam? There never was much hope. Just a fool's hope. Our enemy is ready. His full strength's gathered. Not only Orcs, but Men as well. Legions of Haradrim from the south. mercenaries from the coast. All will answer Mordor's call. Come on. This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest. If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls. the last defense of this city will be gone. But we have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something. Gandalf? Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant. the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war. The one they say no living man can kill. The Witch King of Angmar. You've met him before. He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop. He is the lord of the Nazgul. the greatest of the Nine. Minas Morgul is his lair. The Dead City. Very nasty place. Full of enemies. Quick. Quick. They will see. They will see. Come away. Come away. Look, we have found it. The way into Mordor. The secret stair. Climb. No, Mr. Frodo! Not that way! What's it doing? No. They're calling me. No. Hide! Hide! I can feel his blade. We come to it at last. The great battle of our time. Come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb. The board is set. The pieces are moving. Up, up, up the stairs we go. And then it's into the tunnel. Hey, what's in this tunnel? You listen to me, and you listen good and proper. Anything happens to him, you have me to answer to. One sniff something's not right. one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over. No more slinker. No more stinker. You're gone. Got it? I'm watching you. What was that about? Nothing. Just clearing something up. Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shirefolk to prove their great worth. You must not fail me. It's been very quiet across the river. The Orcs are lying low. The garrison may have moved out. We've sent scouts to Cair Andros. If the Orcs attack from the north, we'll have some warning. Quiet. We need 10 more. Kill him! They're not coming from the north. To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on. Faster. Draw swords. Hold! Hold them! What? Amon Din The beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit. Hope is kindled. The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit! Gondor calls for aid. And Rohan will answer. Muster the Rohirrim. Assemble the army at Dunharrow. As many men as can be found. You have two days. On the third, we ride for Gondor and war. Forward. Very good, sir. Gamling. My lord. Make haste across the Riddermark. Summon every ablebodied man to Dunharrow. I will. Will you ride with us? Just to the encampment. It's tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men. The men have found their captain. They will follow you into battle, even to death. You have given us hope. Excuse me. I have a sword. Please accept it. I offer you my service, Theoden King. And gladly I accept it. You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan. HorseMen. I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves, fully armed and filthy. Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war. I fear war already marches on their own lands. So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith. the doom of our time will be decided. Now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken. Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land! Faramir! We can't hold them. The city is lost. Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith. Nazgul. Take cover! Nazgul! Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith! Fall back! Retreat! Retreat! Run for your lives! The age of Men is over. The time of the Orc has come. Keep going. It's the Nazgul. Take cover, my lord! It's coming! It's Mithrandir. The White Rider! Pull! Mithrandir. They broke through our defenses. They've taken the bridge and the west bank. Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river. It is as the Lord Denethor predicted. Long has he foreseen this doom. Foreseen and done nothing. Faramir? This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path. No. You've seen Frodo and Sam? Where? When? In Ithilien. Not two days ago. Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale. And then the pass of Cirith Ungol. What does that mean? What's wrong? Faramir, tell me everything. Tell me all you know. This is how you would serve your city? You would risk its utter ruin? I did what I judged to be right. What you judged to be right. You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor in the hands of a witless Halfling. It should have been brought back to the Citadel to be kept safe. Hidden. Dark and deep in the vaults. not to be used. Unless at the uttermost end of need. I would not use the Ring. Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and I alone could save her. Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious. as a king of old. Boromir would have remembered his father's need. He would have brought me a kingly gift. Boromir would not have brought the Ring. He would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taken it. He would've fallen. You know nothing of this matter! He would have kept it for his own. And when he returned. you would not have known your son. Boromir was loyal to me! Not some wizard's pupil! Father? My son. Leave me. Careful, master. Careful. Very far to fall. Very dangerous are the stairs. Come, master. Come to Smeagol. Mr. Frodo. Get back, you! Don't touch him! Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has Smeagol ever done to him? Master? Master carries heavy burden. Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden. Fat one cannot know. Smeagol look after master. He wants it. He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye. Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see. The fat one will take it from you. Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. Slay them all. What of the wizard? I will break him. Where are Theoden's riders? Will Rohan's army come? Mithrandir. Courage is the best defense that you have now. What were you thinking, Peregrin Took? What service can a Hobbit offer such a great lord of Men? It was welldone. A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel. You are to join the tower guard. I didn't think they would find any livery that would fit me. Once belonged to a young boy of the city. A very foolish one. who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending to his studies. This was yours? Yes, it was mine. My father had it made for me. Well. I'm taller than you were then. Though I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways. Never fitted me either. Boromir was always the soldier. They were so alike, he and my father. Proud. Stubborn even. But strong. I think you have strength of a different kind. And one day your father will see it. Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor. in peace or war. in living or dying. from. From this hour henceforth. until my lord release me. or death take me. And I shall not forget it. nor fail to reward that which is given. Fealty with love. Valor with honor. Disloyalty with vengeance. I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses. defenses that your brother long held intact. What would you have me do? I will not yield. the river in Pelennor unfought. Osgiliath must be retaken. My lord, Osgiliath is overrun. Much must be risked in war. Is there a captain here who still has the courage to do his lord's will? You wish now that our places had been exchanged. that I had died and Boromir had lived. Yes. I wish that. Since you were robbed of Boromir. I will do what I can in his stead. If I should return, think better of me, Father. That will depend on the manner of your return. What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we? Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find. and they say sneak. Sneak? Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious. Very nice, very nice. All right. All right! You just startled me is all. What were you doing? Sneaking. Fine. Have it your own way. I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo. We have to be moving on. It's dark still. It's always dark here. It's gone! The Elven bread. What? That's all we have left. He took it. He must have! Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread. You're a lying rat! What did you do with it?! He doesn't eat it. He can't have taken it. Look. What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it! He took it. I seen him. He's always stuffing his face when master's not looking. That's a filthy lie! You stinking, twofaced sneak! Sam! Call me. Stop it! Sam! I'll kill him! Sam! No! Oh, my. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to go so far. I was just so. So angry. Here, just. Let's just rest a bit. I'm all right. No. No, you're not all right. You're exhausted. It's that Gollum. It's this place. It's that thing around your neck. I could help a bit. I could carry it for a while. Carry it for a while. I could carry it. I could carry it. Share the load. Share the load. the load. the load. Get away! I don't want to keep it. I just want to help. See? See? He wants it for himself. Shut up, you! Go away! Get out of here! No, Sam. It's you. I'm sorry, Sam. But he's a liar. He's poisoned you against me. You can't help me anymore. You don't mean that. Go home. Faramir! Faramir! Your father's will has turned to madness. Do not throw away your life so rashly. Where does my allegiance lie if not here? This is the city of the Men of Numenor. I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty. her memory, her wisdom. Your father loves you, Faramir. He will remember it before the end. Can you sing, Master Hobbit? Well. yes. At least, well enough for my own people. But we have no songs for great halls. and evil times. And why should your songs be unfit for my halls? Come, sing me a song. Home is behind The world ahead And there are many paths to tread Through shadow To the edge of night Until the stars are all alight Mist and shadow Cloud and shade All shall fade All shall Fade March! March! March! March! March! Make way for the king. Make way. The king is here. My lord. Hail to you, sire. Grimbold, how many? I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord. We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King. Where are the riders from Snowborn? None have come, my lord. Six thousand spears. Less than half of what I'd hoped for. Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor. More will come. Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat. We have till dawn, then we must ride. The horses are restless. and the men are quiet. They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain. That road there. where does that lead? It is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain. None who venture there ever return. That mountain is evil. Aragorn. Let's find some food. There. A true esquire of Rohan. I'm ready. Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous. It's not even sharp. Well, that's no good. You won't kill many Orcs with a blunt blade. Come on. To the smithy. Go! You should not encourage him. You should not doubt him. I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm. Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause to go to war as you. Why can he not fight for those he loves? You know as little of war as that Hobbit. When the fear takes him. and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold. do you think he would stand and fight? He would flee. And he would be right to do so. War is the province of Men, Eowyn. I choose a mortal life. I wish I could've seen him. one last time. Sir? King Theoden awaits you, my lord. I take my leave. My lord Elrond. I come on behalf of one whom I love. Arwen is dying. She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor. The light of the Evenstar is failing. As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes. Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn. The end has come. It will not be our end, but his. You ride to war, but not to victory. Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know. But in secret he sends another force which will attack from the river. A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south. They'll be in the city in two days. You're outnumbered, Aragorn. You need more men. There are none. There are those who dwell in the mountain. Murderers. traitors. You would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no one. They will answer to the king of Gondor. Anduril, the Flame of the West, forged from the shards of Narsil. Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil. The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith. The man who can wield the power of this sword. can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. Put aside the Ranger. Become who you were born to be. Take the Dimholt road. I give hope to Men. I keep none for myself. Why are you doing this? The war lies to the east. You cannot leave on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon the men. Eowyn. We need you here. Why have you come? Do you not know? It is but a shadow and a thought that you love. I cannot give you what you seek. I have wished you joy since first I saw you. Just where do you think you're off to? Not this time. This time you must stay, Gimli. Have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves? You might as well accept it. We're going with you, laddie. What's happening? Where is he going? Where's he going? I don't understand. Lord Aragorn! Why does he leave on the eve of battle? He leaves because there is no hope. He leaves because he must. Too few have come. We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor. No. we cannot. But we will meet them in battle nonetheless. I have left instruction. The people are to follow your rule in my stead. Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras. if the battle goes ill. What other duty would you have me do, my lord? Duty? No. I would have you smile again. not grieve for those whose time has come. You shall live to see these days renewed. and no more despair. What kind of army would linger in such a place? One that is cursed. Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath. to the last king of Gondor. to come to his aid. to fight. But when the time came. when Gondor's need was dire. they fled. vanishing into the darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them. never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge. Who shall call them from the grey twilight? The forgotten people. The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. From the north shall he come. Need shall drive him. He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead. The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away. The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead. And the Dead keep it. The way is shut. Brego! I do not fear death. Well, this is a thing unheardof. An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not? Oh. Oh, I'd never hear the end of it. We must ride light and swift. It is a long road ahead. And man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight. Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc. All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left behind. It is a threeday gallop to Minas Tirith. And none of my riders can bear you as a burden. I want to fight. I will say no more. Ride with me. My lady. Form up! Move out! Form up! Move out! Ride! Ride now to Gondor! What is it? What do you see? I see shapes of men. And of horses. Where? Pale banners like shreds of cloud. Spears rise. like winterthickets through a shroud of mist. The Dead are following. They have been summoned. The Dead? Summoned? I knew that. Very good. Very good! Legolas! Do not look down. Who enters my domain? One who will have your allegiance. The Dead do not suffer the living to pass. You will suffer me. The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead. And the Dead keep it. The way is shut. Now you must die. I summon you to fulfill your oath. None but the king of Gondor may command me. That line was broken. It has been remade. Fight for us. and regain your honor. What say you? What say you? You waste your time, Aragorn. They had no honor in life, they have none now in death. I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me. and I will hold your oaths fulfilled. What say you? You have my word! Fight, and I will release you from this living death! What say you?! Stand, you traitors! Out! Legolas! Run! We fight. Open the gate! Quick! Quick! Hurry! Faramir! Say not that he has fallen. They were outnumbered. None survived. Fear. The city is rank with it. Let us ease their pain. Release the prisoners. Catapults! My sons are spent. My line has ended. He's alive! The House of Stewards has failed. He needs medicine, my lord. My line has ended! My lord! Rohan. has deserted us. Theoden's betrayed me. Abandon your posts! Flee! Flee for your lives! Prepare for battle! Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall! Over here! Return to your posts! Send these foul beasts into the abyss. Stay where you are. We need more rubble! Watch out! Down to the lower levels. Quick! Double up, men! Hold them back! Do not give in to fear. Stand to your posts! Fight! Not at the towers! Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls! Bring them down! Fight them back! Peregrin Took! Go back to the Citadel! They'd called us out to fight. This is no place for a Hobbit. Guard of the Citadel, indeed. Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick! What are you doing, you useless scum?! The door won't give. It's too strong. Get back there and smash it down. But nothing can breach it. Grond will breach it. Bring up the wolf's head. Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond! You may go no further. You will not enter Gondor. Who are you to deny us passage? Legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear. Mind your aim. That's it. Right. We warned you. Prepare to be boarded. Boarded? By you and whose army? This army. In there. What is this place? Master must go inside the tunnel. Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to. It's the only way. Go in. or go back. I can't go back. What's that smell? Orcses' filth. Orcses come in here sometimes. Hurry. This way. Smeagol? Over here. It's sticky. What is it? You will see. Oh, yes. You will see. Smeagol? Smeagol! Smeagol! Sam. And you, Frodo Baggins. I give you the light of Earendil, our most beloved star. May it be a light for you in dark places. when all other lights go out. Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima! Naughty little fly. Why does he cry? Caught in a web Soon you'll be. Eaten. Got away, did it, precious? Not this time. Not this time! No! It wasn't us. It wasn't us! Smeagol wouldn't hurt master. We promised. You must believe us. It was the precious. The precious made us do it. I have to destroy it, Smeagol. I have to destroy it for both our sakes. No! I'm so sorry, Sam. I'm so sorry. This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire. If you do not find a way. no one will. The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded. The lower level's in flames. Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance. Time is against us. Make ready! Take heart, Merry. It will soon be over. My lady. you are fair and brave. and have much to live for. and many who love you. I know it is too late to turn aside. I know there is not much point now in hoping. If I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds. But I'm not. I'm a Hobbit. And I know I can't save Middleearth. I just want to help my friends. Frodo. Sam. Pippin. More than anything, I wish I could see them again. Prepare to move out! Make haste. We ride through the night. To battle. To battle. Back to the gate! Hurry! I am steward of the House of Anarion. Thus have I walked. And thus now will I sleep. Gondor is lost. There is no hope for Men. Why do the fools fly? Better to die sooner than late. For die we must. No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long, slow sleep of death embalmed. We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old. Bring wood and oil. Steady. Steady. You are soldiers of Gondor. No matter what comes through that gate, you will stand your ground. Run! Volley! Fire! Let him go, you filth. Let him go! You will not touch him again. Come on and finish it. Back! Mr. Frodo. Oh, no. Frodo. Mr. Frodo. Wake up. Don't leave me here alone. Don't go where I can't follow. Wake up. Not asleep. Dead. You get back, you scum! What's this? Looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun. Killed another one, has she? No. This fellow ain't dead. Not dead? She jabs him with her stinger, and he goes as limp as a boned fish. Then she has her way with them. That's how she likes to feed. Fresh blood. Get him to the tower! Samwise, you fool. This scum will be awake in a couple of hours. Then he'll wish he'd never been born. The house of his spirit crumbles. He is burning. Already burning. He's not dead. He's not dead! No! No! No! No! He's not dead! Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin. No! No! No! I release you from my service. Go now and die in what way seems best to you. Pour oil on the wood! Come on, soldier! Move it! Hurry along there! Hurry along! Gandalf! Where is Gandalf? Gandalf! Retreat! The city is breached! Fall back! To the second level! Get the women and children out! Get them out! Retreat! Come on. Come on, move. Move into the city. Kill all in your path. Take them down! Fight! Fight to the last man! Fight for your lives! Gandalf! Gandalf! Denethor has lost his mind! He's burning Faramir alive! Up! Quickly! Go back to the abyss. Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master. Do you not know death when you see it, old man? This is my hour. Gandalf! You have failed. The world of Men will fall. Courage, Merry. Courage for our friends. Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks! Pikes in front. Archers behind. Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank. Flank ready. Gamling, follow the king's banner down the center. Grimbold, take your company right after you pass the wall. Forth, and fear no darkness! Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden! Spears shall be shaken. Shields shall be splintered. a swordday, a red day. and the sun rises! Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you. Ride now! Ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin. and the world's ending! Death! Death! Death! Death! Death! Death! Death! Death! For Eorlingas! Fire! Death! Charge! Fire at will! Set a fire in our flesh. Stay this madness! You may triumph in the field of battle for a day. but against the power that has risen in the east. there is no victory. No! You will not take my son from me! No! Faramir. So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion. Drive them to the river! Make safe the city! Reform the line! Reform the line! Sound the charge! Take them headon! Charge! Cut him down! Take the reins. Pull him left! Left! Aim for their heads! Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down! Merry! Merry! I didn't think it would end this way. End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path. one that we all must take. The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back. and all turns to silver glass. And then you see it. What, Gandalf? See what? White shores. and beyond. A far green country. under a swift sunrise. Well. that isn't so bad. No. No, it isn't. Rally to me! To me! Feast on his flesh. I will kill you if you touch him. Do not come between the Nazgul and his prey. Late as usual, pirate scum! There's knifework here needs doing. Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships! There's plenty for the both of us. May the best Dwarf win. You fool. No man can kill me. Die now. I am no man. 15! 16! 17! Merry! Legolas! 33, 34. That still only counts as one! Come on, then. Come on! I know your face. Eowyn. My eyes darken. No. No. I am going to save you. You already did. Eowyn. my body is broken. You have to let me go. I go to my fathers. in whose mighty company. I shall not now feel ashamed. Eowyn. Release us. Bad idea. Very handy in a tight spot, these lads, despite the fact they're dead. You gave us your word. I hold your oath fulfilled. Go. Be at peace. Merry. No! No! With a sigh. You turn away. With a deepening heart. No more words to say. You will find. That the world has changed forever. And the trees are now turning from green to gold. And the sun is now fading. I wish I could hold you closer. Merry! Merry! Merry. Merry, it's me. It's Pippin. I knew you'd find me. Yes. Are you going to leave me? No, Merry. I'm going to look after you. Hands off! That shiny shirt, that's mine. It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else. I don't take orders from stinking Morgulrats! You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut. The scum tried to knife me. Kill him! That's for Frodo! And for the Shire! And that's for my old Gaffer! Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat. I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig. Not if I stick you first. Sam! Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry. Sorry for everything. Let's get you out of here. It's too late. It's over. They've taken it. Sam. they took the Ring. Begging your pardon, but they haven't. I thought I'd lost you. So I took it. Only for safekeeping. Give it to me. Give me the Ring, Sam. Sam. Give me the Ring. You must understand. The Ring is my burden. It will destroy you, Sam. Come on, Mr. Frodo. We best find you some clothes. You can't go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin. We did it, Mr. Frodo. We made it to Mordor. There are so many of them. We'll never get through unseen. It's him, the Eye. We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo. There's nothing for it. Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters. Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The darkness is deepening. If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it. It's only a matter of time. He has suffered a defeat, yes but. behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping. Let him stay there. Let him rot! Why should we care? Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom. I've sent him to his death. No. There is still hope for Frodo. He needs time and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth. We can give him that. How? Draw out Sauron's armies. Empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate. We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms. Not for ourselves. But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to all else that moves. A diversion. Certainty of death. small chance of success. what are we waiting for? Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait. Oh, I think he will. Long have you hunted me. Long have I eluded you. No more. Behold the Sword of Elendil. The city has fallen silent. There is no warmth left in the sun. It grows so cold. It's just the damp of the first spring rain. I do not believe this darkness will endure. Look, the Orcs. they're moving off. You see, Mr. Frodo. some luck at last. Move it, you slugs! Come on! Faster! Come along, you coldhearted wretched scum. I'll whip you down to the bone, you. Come on! What have I told you? No evation. Now move it! Get up! Come on, you slugs! You two are going straight to the front line! Now, move it! Go on! Fall in! Move it! Move it! Move it! To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it! Don't you know we're at war? Company, halt! Inspection! Sam, help me. Mr. Frodo! Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up! It's so heavy. Oh, no. What do I do? What do we do? Hit me. What? Hit me, Sam. Start fighting. Get off of me! Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot. Get off of me! Break it up! Break it up! Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't shut this rabble down! Go, Sam. Now! Move along, scum! Back in the line! You maggots! Get back into the line, you slugs! Dig it, you slugs. Move it. I can't. I can't. I can't manage the Ring, Sam. It's. It's. It's such a weight to carry. It's. Such a weight. We're going that way. Straight as we can. There's no point carrying anything we're not sure to need. Mr. Frodo. Look. There is light. and beauty up there. that no shadow can touch. Take mine. There's a few drops left. There will be none left for the return journey. I don't think there will be a return journey, Mr. Frodo. Frodo, get down! Hide! Frodo! Where are they? Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth! Let justice be done upon him! My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome. Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me? We do not come to treat with Sauron. faithless and accursed. armies of Mordor must disband. He is to depart these lands, never to return. Old Greybeard. I have a token I was bidden to show thee. Frodo. Frodo. Silence. No! Silence! The Halfling was dear to thee, I see. Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain? And he did, Gandalf. He did. And who is this? Isildur's heir? It takes more to make a king than a broken Elvish blade. I guess that concludes negotiations. I do not believe it. I will not. Pull back. Pull back! It's gone, Mr. Frodo. The light's passed on, away towards the north. Something's drawn its gaze. Hold your ground! Hold your ground. Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers! I see in your eyes. the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of Men fails. when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. But it is not this day. An hour of wolves and shattered shields. when the age of Men comes crashing down. But it is not this day. This day we fight! By all that you hold dear on this good earth. I bid you stand, Men of the West! Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an Elf. What about side by side with a friend? Aye. I could do that. Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo? It'll be spring soon. And the orchards will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket. And they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields. and eating the first of the strawberries with cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries? No, Sam. I can't recall the taste of food. nor the sound of water. nor the touch of grass. I'm. naked in the dark. There's. there's nothing. No veil between me and the wheel of fire. I can see him. with my waking eyes. Then let us be rid of it. once and for all. Come on, Mr. Frodo. I can't carry it for you. but I can carry you. Come on! Aragorn. Elessar. For Frodo. Look, Mr. Frodo. A doorway. We're almost there. Clever Hobbits to climb so high! Mustn't go that way. Mustn't hurt the precious. You swore! You swore on the precious! Smeagol promised! Smeagol lied. Frodo! Eagles. The eagles are coming! Frodo! I'm here, Sam. Destroy it! Go on! Now! Throw it in the fire! What are you waiting for? Just let it go! The Ring is mine. No. No. No! Yes! Yes! Precious! Precious! Precious! Precious! Give me your hand! Take my hand! No! Don't you let go. Don't let go. Reach! Frodo! Frodo! It's gone. It's done. Yes, Mr. Frodo. It's over now. I can see the Shire. The Brandywine River. Bag End. Gandalf's fireworks. The lights in the Party Tree. Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone. it would've been her. It would've been her. I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee. here at the end of all things. Gandalf? Frodo! Gimli! Now come the days of the king. May they be blessed. This day does not belong to one man. but to all. Let us together rebuild this world. that we may share in the days of peace. Et Earello. Endorenna utulien. Sinome maruvan. ar Hildinyar. tenn' Ambarmetta. Hannon le. My friends. you bow to no one. And thus it was. A Fourth Age of Middleearth began. And the Fellowship of the Ring. though eternally bound by friendship and love. was ended. Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey. we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight. We were home. Hi. Hey, watch the pumpkin. More of the same, Rosie. Good night, lads. How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on. when in your heart you begin to understand. there is no going back? There are some things that time cannot mend. some hurts that go too deep. that have taken hold. Mr. Frodo? What is it? It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed. There and Back Again. A Hobbit's tale by Bilbo Baggins. And The Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins. You finished it. Not quite. There's room for a little more. Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end. that each of us must come and go in the telling. Bilbo's story was now over. There would be no more journeys for him. save one. Tell me again, lad, where are we going? To the harbor, Bilbo. The Elves have accorded you a special honor. a place on the last ship to leave Middleearth. Frodo. any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again? The one I gave you. I'm sorry, Uncle. I'm afraid I lost it. Oh. Pity. I should like to have held it one last time. Well, here's a sight I have never seen before. The power of the Three Rings is ended. The time has come. for the dominion of Men. I Aear can ven na mar. I think I'm. quite ready for another adventure. Farewell. my brave Hobbits. My work is now finished. Here at last, on the shores of the sea. comes the end of our Fellowship. I will not say, Do not weep. for not all tears are an evil. It is time, Frodo. What does he mean? We set out to save the Shire, Sam. And it has been saved. But not for me. You don't mean that. You can't leave. The last pages are for you, Sam. My dear Sam You cannot always be torn in two. You will have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do. Your part in the story will go on. Well. I'm back.
