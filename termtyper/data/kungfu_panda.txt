Legend tells of a legendary warrior. whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend. He traveled the land in search of worthy foes. I see you like to chew. Maybe you should chew on my fist! The warrior said nothing, for his mouth was full. Then he swallowed. And then he spoke. Enough talk. Let's fight! Shashabooey! He was so deadly in fact, that his enemies would go blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness. My eyes! He's too awesome! And attractive. How can we repay you? There is no charge for awesomeness. Or attractiveness. Kablooey! It mattered not how many foes he faced. They were no match for his bodacity! Never before had a panda been so feared! And so loved. Even the most heroic heroes in China, the Furious Five, bowed in respect to this great master. We should hang out. Agreed. But hanging out would have to wait. Because when you're facing the 10,000 demons of Demon Mountain, there's only one thing that matters and that's. Po! Get up! You'll be later for work! What? Po! Get up! Po. What are you doing up there? Nothing. Monkey! Mantis! Orange! Viper! Tigress! Po! Let's go! You're late for work. Coming! Sorry, Dad. Sorry doesn't make the noodles. What were you doing up there? All that noise. Nothing. I just had a crazy dream. About what? What were you dreaming about? What was I? I was dreaming about. noodles. Noodles? You were really dreaming about noodles? Yeah. What else would I be dreaming about? Careful! That soup is sharp. Oh, happy day! My son, finally having the noodle dream! You don't know how long I've been waiting for this moment. This is a sign, Po. A sign of what? You are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup. Then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant! As I took it over from my father, who took it over from his father. who won it from a friend in mahjong. Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream. No, it was the dream. We are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins. But, Dad, didn't you ever want to do something else? Something besides noodles? Actually, when I was young and crazy, I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu. Why didn't you? Because it was a stupid dream. Can you imagine me making tofu? Tofu. No! We all have our place in this world. Mine is here, and yours is. I know, is here. No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12 Service with a smile. Well done, students. if you were trying to disappoint me. Tigress, you need more ferocity! Monkey, greater speed. Orange, height. Viper, subtlety. Mantis. Master Shifu. What?! It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you. Master Oogway, you summoned me? Is something wrong? Why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend? So, nothing's wrong? Well, I didn't say that. You were saying? I have had a vision. Tai Lung will return. That is impossible! He is in prison. Nothing is impossible. Zeng! Fly to ChorhGom prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons, double everything! Tai Lung does not leave that prison! Yes, Master Shifu! One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it. We must do something! We can't let him march on the valley, take his revenge! He'll. Your mind is like this water, my friend. When it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see. But if you allow it to settle. the answer becomes clear. The Dragon Scroll. It is time. But who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power? To become the Dragon Warrior? I don't know. Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry. Watch it! Sorry. Suck it up! Sorry. A thousand pardons. What? Master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior! Today! Everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll! We've waited 1,000 years for this! Take the bowl! This is the greatest day in kung fu history! Just go! Po! Where are you going? To the Jade Palace. You're forgetting your noodle cart. The whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them. Selling noodles? But, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I. Yeah? I was thinking maybe I. could also sell the bean buns. They're about to go bad. That's my boy! I told you that dream was a sign. Yeah. Glad I had it. I'm a kung fu warrior! Me, too! There's spots at the top. Let's go. Come on. Come on! Almost there. What? No! Oh, no! Sorry, Po. We'll bring you back a souvenir. No. I'll bring me back a souvenir. It is an historic day. Isn't it, Master Oogway? Yes, and one I feared I would not live to see. Are your students ready? Yes, Master Oogway. Know this, old friend. Whomever I choose will not only bring peace to the valley. but also to you. Let the tournament begin! Yeah. No, no, wait! I'm coming! Wait, wait! Yes! Hey! Open the door! Let me in! Citizens of the Valley of Peace, it is my great honor to present to you. Tigress! Viper! Orange! Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five! Yeah, the Furious Five! Warriors, prepare! Wait. No. Oh, peekyhole. Ready for battle! Yeah. The Thousand Tongues of Fire. Look at that. Hey! Get out of the way! And finally Master Tigress! And believe me, citizens, you have not seen anything yet. I know! Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox and his Blades of Death. I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us. Citizens of the Valley of Peace, Master Oogway will now choose the Dragon Warrior! Oh, no! No, no, wait! Yeah. Po! What are you doing?! What does it look like I'm doing?! Stop! I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior! But I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream! I lied. I don't dream about noodles, Dad. I love kung fu! Come on, son. Let's get back to work. OK. Come back! What's going on? Where? What are you pointing? OK. Sorry. I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was. How interesting. Master, are you pointing at me? Him. Who? You. Me? The universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior! What? What?! What?! What?! Stop, wait! Who told you to? Master Oogway, wait. That flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to our problem. You were about to point at Tigress and that thing fell in front of her! That was just an accident! There are no accidents. Forgive us, Master. We have failed you. No. If the panda has not quit by morning then I will have failed you. Wait! Wait, wait, wait! I bring a message. from Master Shifu. What?! Double the guard?! Extra precautions?! Your prison may not be adequate?! You doubt my prison security?! Absolutely not. Shifu does. I'm just the messenger. I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu. Escape from ChorhGom prison is impossible! Impressive, isn't it? It's very impressive. It's very impressive. One way in, one way out. One thousand guards and one prisoner. Yes, except that prisoner. is Tai Lung. Take us down. What are you doing? Oh, my. Behold Tai Lung. I'm just gonna wait right here. It's nothing to worry about. It's perfectly safe. Crossbows! At the ready! Crossbows? Hey, tough guy, did you hear? Oogway√≠s giving someone the Dragon Scroll, and it's not gonna be you. Don't get him mad. What's he gonna do about it? I've got him completely immobilized. Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail? I'm good. I've seen enough. I'll tell Shifu he has nothing to worry about. No, he doesn't. I'll tell him that. Can we please go now? Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior! Wait a second! I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm. The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way! Look at this place. Master Flying Rhino's armor, with authentic battle damage! The Sword of Heroes! Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking. The Invisible Trident of Destiny! I've only seen paintings of that painting. No! The legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors. Said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu Army. Hello. Have you finished sightseeing? Sorry, I should have come to you first. My patience is wearing thin. Well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere. Would you turn around? Sure. How's it going? How do you get 5,000. Master Shifu! Someone. broke that. But I'll fix it. Do you have some. glue? A splinter. So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior? I guess so. Wrong! You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until. you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll. So, how does this work? Do you have a ladder, or a trampoline, or? You think it's that easy? That I'll just hand you the secret to limitless power? No, I. One must first master the highest level of kung fu. And that is impossible if that one is someone like you. Someone like me? Yes, look at you! This fat butt! Flabby arms! Those are sensitive in the flabby parts. And this ridiculous belly. And utter disregard for personal hygiene. Now, wait a minute. That's uncalled for. Don't stand that close. I can smell your breath. Listen, Oogway said I was. The Wuxi Finger Hold. Not the Wuxi Finger Hold! Oh, you know this hold? Developed by Master Wuxi in the Third Dynasty. Then you know what happens when I flex my pinky. No, no! You know the hardest part of this? The hardest part is cleaning up afterwards. OK, OK, take it easy. Now listen closely, panda. Oogway may have picked you, but when I'm through with you, I promise you, you're going to wish he hadn't! Are we clear? Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear. Good. I can't wait to get started. Let's begin. Wait, wait, wait. What? Now? Yes, now. Unless the great Oogway was wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior. Oh, OK, well. I don't know if I can do all of those moves. Well, if we don't try, we'll never know, will we? Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level. What level is that? Well, I'm not a master, but. let's just start at zero. Level zero. No. There is no such thing as level zero. Maybe I can start with that. That? We use that for training children and propping the door open when it's hot. But if you insist. The Furious Five! You're bigger than your action figures. Except, you, Mantis. You're the same. Go ahead, panda. Show us what you can do. Are they gonna watch, or should I wait till they get back to work? Hit it. OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate. So I'm still digesting. So my kung fu might not be as good as. later on. Just hit it. All right. What you got? You got nothing, 'cause I got it right here. You picking on my friends? Get ready to feel thunder. I'm coming at you with crazy feet. Come on. I'm a blur. You've never seen bear style. You've only seen praying mantis. Or monkey style. Or I could come at you snicketysnake. Would you hit it! All right. All right. Why don't you try again? A little harder. How's that? That hurts. This will be easier than I thought. I'm feeling a little nauseous! Those are hard! My tenders. How did I do? There is now a level zero. There's no words. No denying that. What was Master Oogway thinking? The poor guy's gonna get himself killed. He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire! When he walks, the very ground shakes! One would think Master Oogway would choose someone who knew kung fu. Yeah, or could at least touch his toes. Or even see his toes. OK. Great. Hi. You're up. I am now. I was just. Some day, huh? That kung fu stuff is hard work, right? Are your biceps sore? I've had a long and rather disappointing day, so. Yeah, I should probably get to sleep now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. OK, thanks. It's just. Man, I'm such a big fan! You guys were amazing at the Battle of Weeping River. Outnumbered a thousand to one, but you didn't stop. You just. Sorry about that. Look, you don't belong here. I know. I know. You're right. I don't have. I just. My whole life I dreamed of. No, I meant you don't belong here. I mean, in this room. This is my room. Property of Orange. OK. Right, right. So, you want to get to sleep. Yeah. I'm keeping you up. We got big things tomorrow. All right. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Byebye. What was that? I didn't say anything. OK. All right. Good night. Sleep well. That seemed a little awkward. Master Tigress! I didn't mean to wake you. You don't belong here. Yeah, of course. This is your room. I mean, you don't belong in the Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to kung fu, and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do, you will be gone by morning. Big fan! I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom. Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree. I understand. You eat when you are upset. Upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset. So why are you so upset? I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu. In the history of China. In the history of sucking! Probably. And the Five! Man, you should've seen them! They totally hate me. Totally. How is Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior? I mean, I'm not like the Five. I've got no claws, no wings, no venom. Even Mantis has those. thingies. Maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles. Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't noodles. You are too concerned with what was and what will be. Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the present. Oh, no! What's happening?! To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go! Fire crossbows! Fire! Fire! Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu. Not going anywhere! Neither is he! Let go of me! Bring it up! Wait! Bring it back! He's coming this way! He won't get far. Archers! We're dead. So very, very dead. Not yet we're not. Now! Can we run now? Yes. I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was beginning to think I'd been forgotten. Fly back there and tell them. the real Dragon Warrior is coming home. Good morning, Master! Panda! Panda! Wake up! He's quit. What do we do now, with the panda gone? Who will be the Dragon Warrior? All we can do is resume our training and trust that in time, the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed. What are you doing here?! Hi! Good morning, Master! I thought I'd warm up a little. You're stuck. Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck? Nah. This is one of my. Yeah, I'm stuck. Help him. Oh, dear. Maybe on three. One, two. three. Thank you. Don't mention it. No, really, I appreciate. Ever. You actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night? It takes years to develop one's flexibility! And years longer to apply it in combat! Put that down! The only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones. Yeah! Excellent. Let's get started. Are you ready? I was born re. I'm sorry, brother. I thought you said you were ready. That was awesome! Let's go again! I've been taking it easy on you, panda. But no more. Your next opponent will be me. All right! Yeah, let's go! Step forth. The true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness. and make him suffer for it. Oh, yeah! To take his strength and use it against him. until he finally falls. or quits. A real warrior never quits. Don't worry, Master. I will never quit! If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps. But he will. He's not going to quit, is he? He's not going to quit bouncing, I'll tell you that. I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better. Trust me, it will. It's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this. Fat? Fur. I was going to say fur. Sure you were. Who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? Look at me. I'm over here. Maybe you should look at this again. Oh, OK. Stop it. Stop! I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all. but if I didn't know better, I'd say he was trying to get rid of me. I know he can seem kind of heartless. but he wasn't always like that. According to legend, there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile. No! Yes. But that was before. Before what? Before Tai Lung. We're not really supposed to talk about him. Well, if he's going to stay here, he should know. Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung. He was a student. The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu. And then he turned bad, and now he's in jail. He wasn√≠t just a student. Shifu found him as a cub. and he raised him as his son. And when the boy showed talent in kung fu. Shifu trained him. He believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness. It was never enough for Tai Lung. He wanted the Dragon Scroll. But Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused. Outraged, Tai Lung laid waste to the valley. He tried to take the scroll by force. And Shifu had to destroy what he had created. But how could he? Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before. Or since. And now he has a chance to make things right. To train the true Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with you. A big fat panda who treats it like a joke. That is it! Wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve. And may have also stopped his heart. Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner. Inner peace. Would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down?! Inner. Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use some good news right now. Master! Master! I have. It's. It's very bad news. Shifu. There is just news. There is no good or bad. Master, your vision. Your vision was right. Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way. That is bad news. if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him. The panda? Master, that panda is not the Dragon Warrior. He wasn't meant to be here! It was an accident. There are no accidents. Yes, I know. You've said that already. Twice. Well, that was no accident, either. Thrice. My old friend, the panda will never fulfill his destiny, nor you yours, until you let go of the illusion of control. Illusion? Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu. I cannot make it blossom when it suits me, nor make it bear fruit before its time. But there are things we can control. I can control when the fruit will fall. And I can control. where to plant the seed. That is no illusion, Master. Yes. But no matter what you do that seed will grow to be a peach tree. You may wish for an apple or an orange, but you will get a peach. But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung! Maybe it can. If you are willing to guide it. To nurture it. To believe in it. But how? How? I need your help, Master. No, you just need to believe. Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you will believe. I will try. Good. My time has come. You must continue your journey without me. What are you? Wait! Master! You can't leave me! You must believe. Master! Yeah, so I'm like, Fine, you may be a wolf, you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province. but you're a lousy tipper. Really? So how did you get out of there alive? I mean, I didn't actually say that. but I thought it. in my mind. If he could read my mind, he'd be, like, What? Order up! Hope you like it. This is really good! No, come on. Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient. What do you mean? This is amazing! You're a really good cook. I wish my mouth was bigger. Tigress, you've got to try this. It is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf and the energy of the universe. I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna need a lot more than dew and universe juice. What? Nothing. Master Shifu. Never be the Dragon Warrior unless you lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth! What is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it! Work hard, panda, and maybe someday. you will have ears like mine. That's good. Ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good. It's Shifu! Of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing? Master Shifu! You think this is funny? Tai Lung has escaped and you're acting like children! What? He is coming for the Dragon Scroll, and you are the only one who can stop him. And I was saying you got no sense of humor. I'm gonna. stop Tai Lung. What? You're serious? And I have to? Master Oogway will stop him, like he did before. Oogway cannot! Not anymore. Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior. The panda? Yes, the panda! Master, let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for. No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung. It is his! Where'd he go? You cannot leave! A real warrior never quits. Watch me. Come on. How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs. You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior. You don't believe that. You never believed that. From the beginning, you've tried to get rid of me. Yes! I was. But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine. You're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Then why didn't you quit?! You knew I wanted you gone, yet you stayed. Yeah, I stayed. I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled, it hurt, but it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me. I stayed because I thought, if anyone could change me. could make me. not me. it was you. The greatest kung fu teacher in all of China! But I can change you! I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will! Come on. Tai Lung is on his way here right now. Even if it takes him a hundred years to get here, how are you. gonna change this into the Dragon Warrior? How? How? How?! I don't know! I don't know. That's what I thought. This is what you trained me for. Tigress! Don't try and stop me. We're not trying to stop you. What? We're coming with you! What? I eat when I'm upset, OK? No need to explain. I thought you might be Monkey. He hides his almond cookies on the top shelf. Don't tell Monkey. Look at you. Yeah, I know, I disgust you. No, I mean, how did you get up there? I don't know. I guess that. I don't know. I was getting a cookie. Yet you are ten feet off the ground. And you have done a perfect spilt. No, this? This is just. an accident. There are no accidents. Come with me. I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fuey. but could you at least tell me where we're going? You dragged me. all the way out here. for a bath? Panda. we do not wash our pits in the Pool of Sacred Tears. The Pool of. This is where Oogway unraveled the mysteries. of harmony and focus. This is the birthplace. of kung fu. Do you want to learn kung fu? Yeah! Then I am your master! OK! Don't cry. OK. When you focus on kung fu, when you concentrate. you stink. Perhaps that is my fault. I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five. I now see that the way to get through to you. is with this. Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry. Good. When you have been trained, you may eat. Let us begin. After you, panda. Just like that? No situps? No tenmile hike? I vowed to train you, and you have been trained. You are free to eat. Enjoy. Hey! I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling. Hey! You are free to eat. Am I?! Are you?! I'm not hungry. Master. Out it! Where's the Dragon Warrior? How do you know you're not looking at her? You think I'm a fool? I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you! I heard how he fell out of the sky in a ball of fire. That he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen. Po? So that is his name. Po. Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary! We've got this. Help her. Monkey! Go! What was I thinking?! Mantis! Now! Shifu taught you well. But he didn't teach you everything. You have done well, panda. Done well? Done well? I've done awesome! The mark of a true hero is humility. But, yes, you have done. awesome. Guys? Guys?! They're dead! No, they're breathing. They're asleep? But their eyes are open. We were no match for his nerve attach. He's gotten stronger. Who? Tai Lung? Stronger? He's too fast! Sorry, Po. I thought we could stop him. He could have killed you. Why didn't he? So you could come back and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work. It might. I mean, a little. I'm pretty scared. You can defeat him, panda! Are you kidding? If they can't?! They're five masters. I'm just one me. But you will have the one thing that no one else does. You really believe I'm ready? You are. Po. Behold the Dragon Scroll. It is yours. Wait. What happens when I read it? Legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing beat. Really? That's cool. Yes. And see light in the deepest cave. You will feel the universe in motion around you. Can I punch through walls? Do a quadruple back flip? Focus. Will I? Focus. Focus. Oh, yeah, yeah. Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny. Read it and become. the Dragon Warrior. It's impossible to open. OK. Come on, baby. Come on now. Thank you. I probably loosened it up for you though. OK, here goes. It's blank. What?! Here, look. No, I am forbidden to look upon. Blank. I don't. I don't understand. OK. So, like. Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all. No. Oogway was wiser than us all. Oh, come on! Face it, he picked me by accident. Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding? But who will stop Tai Lung? He'll destroy everything and everyone. No. Evacuate the valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage. What about you, Master? I will fight him. What? I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape. But, Shifu, he'll kill you. Then I will finally have paid for my mistake. Listen to me, all of you. It is time for you to continue your journey without me. I am very proud to have been your master. We've got to get them out safely. Come, little one. Let's find your mama. Viper, gather the southern farmers. Mantis, the north. Orange, light the way. Look, it's the Dragon Warrior. Hey, Dad. Po! Good to have you back, son. Good to be back. Let's go, Po. So for our next shop, it's time to face it. the future of noodles is dicecut vegetables. no longer slices. Also, I was thinking, maybe this time we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in. You like that? Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out. It just wasn't meant to be. Po, forget everything else. Your destiny still awaits. We are noodle folk. Broth runs deep through our veins. I don't know, Dad. Honestly, sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son. Po. I think it's time I told you something I should have told you. a long time ago. OK. The secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup. Come here. The secret ingredient is. nothing. You heard me. Nothing! There is no secret ingredient! Wait, wait. It's just plain old noodle soup? You don't add some kind of special sauce or something? Don't have to. To make something special, you just believe it's special. There is no secret ingredient. I have come home, Master. This is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master. Oh, yes. You have a new favorite. So where is this Po? Did I scare him off? This battle is between you and me. So, that is how it's going to be. That is how it must be. I rotted in jail for 20 years because of your weakness! Obeying your master is not weakness! You knew I was the Dragon Warrior. You always knew. But when Oogway said otherwise, what did you do? What did you do?! Nothing! You were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault! Not your fault?! Who filled my head with dreams?! Who drove me to train until my bones cracked?! Who denied me my destiny?! It was never my decision to make! It is now. Give me the scroll! I would rather die. All I ever did, I did to make you proud! Tell me how proud you are, Shifu! Tell me! Tell me! I have. I have always been proud of you. From the first moment, I've been. proud of you. And it was my pride. that blinded me. I loved you too much to see what you were becoming. what I. was turning you into. I'm. I'm sorry. I don't want your apology. I want my scroll! What?! Where is it?! Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll halfway across China by now. You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung. Never. Never. Stairs. Who are you? Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior. You? Him? He's a panda. You're a panda. What are you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me? Don't tempt me. No. I'm gonna use this. You want it? Come and get it. Finally! That scroll is mine! Lightning! The scroll has given him power! No! Finally! Oh, yes. The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine! It's nothing! It's OK. I didn't get it the first time, either. What? There is no secret ingredient. It's just you. Stop it! I'm gonna pee. Don't. Don't! Don't! You. can't defeat me. You. you're just a big. fat. panda! I'm not a big fat panda. I'm the big fat panda. The Wuxi Finger Hold! Oh, you know this hold? You're bluffing. You're bluffing. Shifu didn't teach you that. Nope. I figured it out. Skadoosh. Look! The Dragon Warrior. That's my boy! That big lovely kung fu warrior is my son! Yes! Thanks, Dad. Hey, guys. Master. Master. Master? Master Shifu! Master! Shifu, are you OK?! Po. You're alive. Or we're both dead. No, Master, I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung. You did? Wow. It is as Oogway foretold. You are the Dragon Warrior. You have brought peace. to this valley. and. and to me. Thank you. Thank you, Po. Thank you. Thank you. No! Master! No, no, no, don't die, Shifu, please! I'm not dying, you idiot! Dragon Warrior. I am simply at peace. Finally. So, I should stop talking? If you can.

Long ago, in ancient China, the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City. They brought great joy and prosperity to the city for they had invented fireworks. But their son, Lord Shen, saw darker power in the fireworks. What had brought colour and joy could also bring darkness and destruction. Shen's troubled parents consulted a soothsayer. She foretold that if Shen continued down this dark path, he would be defeated by a warrior of black and white. The young lord set out to change his fate. But what he did next only sealed it. Shen returned to his parents full of pride. But in their faces, he saw only horror. He was banished from the city forever. But Shen swore revenge. Someday he would return and all of China would bow at his feet. It's almost done, Lord Shen, but we've run out of metal. Search the farthest villages! Find more metal! China will be mine. And then the Dragon Warrior joined the Furious Five! And they became the most awesomest kung fu team ever! Enough talk. Let's fight! Thirtythree. Listen, listen! You can hear the Dragon Warrior training right now! Thirtythree. Stop him! Thirtyfour. It's too dangerous! Thirtyfive. Stay focused. Thirtysix! Thirtyseven! Yeah! How is he doing that with his face? Thirtyeight bean buns! Yes! New record! You monster! Keep going! Hit 40! He'll never hit 40. You guys wait and we'll go to 40. Do it. No problem! Yeah! Give me a minute. Yeah! He did it! Well done, Po! Your training has paid off. Master Shifu! Gotta go. See you later! You'll save those for me, right? Flippetydo. Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace. Master Shifu. Master Shifu, what do we got? Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain? Whatever it is, I will take them down. 'Cause I am in a mood. I need to get something done, you know what I mean? What are you doing? One of Master Oogway's final teachings. Awesome! How did you do that? Inner peace. Inner piece. That's cool. Inner piece of what? It is the next phase of your training. Every master must find his path to inner peace. Some choose to meditate for 50 years in a cave just like this. without the slightest taste of food or water. Or? Some find it through pain and suffering, as I did. Po, the day you were chosen as Dragon Warrior was the worst day of my life. By far. Nothing else came close. It was the worst, most painful, minddestroying, horrible moment. OK. I have ever experienced. But once I realised the problem was not you, but within me, I found inner peace and was able to harness the flow of the universe. So that's it? I just need inner peace? My innards are already super, super peaceful, so all I need to do is just get this thing going. Inner peace, you're going down. Now show me what you were doing there with your feet. I saw you do sort of a fancy foot. Po! Bandits! Approaching the Musicians Village. Danger. Tell those musicians to start playing some action music because it is on. Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master inner peace as soon as I get back. No snack stops this time. Snack stops. Wait, are you serious? Get all the metal you can find! Grab the metal! Help, help, help, help. Help! That's everything! Let's get out of here. Oh, no. Wings of Justice! The Dragon Warrior! A panda? That's impossible. My fist hungers for justice. That was my. fist. Get 'em! Come on! Take that! Po! Incoming! Thanks, Mantis! Tigress, Double Death Strike! Feet of Fury! Tigress! Monkey! Viper! Mantis! Bunny! What? Oh, sorry. Help! Crane, go! I'm on it! Is everyone OK? That was awesome! I got this. Po! Chew on that, tubby! Help. Sweetie, are you OK? What happened? I think I saw. I think. I gotta go. Thank you. Thank you for coming to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu. More tea? Lemon sauce? No. If you need anything, just ask. Thank you. Feet of Fury! The Dragon Warrior's mop. He mopped these very floors! No touching! You'll get the mop dirty. He once waited on me. Awesome! Yeah, I have the stain to prove it. Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior? He doesn't work here any more. He's busy out there protecting the Valley. The Dragon Warrior! There he is. Po! Here. OK. Nice kid. The Dragon Warrior! Should've told me you were coming. Hi, Dad. I would have saved you some stinky tofu. Dad, can I talk to you? Of course, son. In honour of my son, free tofu dessert for everybody! With purchases. Oh, it's so good to see you, Po. Have you lost weight? I can almost put my wings around you. Ah, well, maybe a little. Poor you, you must feel weak. Let me get you some soup. No, that's OK, Dad. I'm not hungry. Not hungry? Po, are you all right? Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just. Earlier today, I was fighting these bandits. Nothing too dangerous. I mean, they were just, you know. Yeah? And then the strangest thing happened. I had this crazy vision. I think I saw my mom and me, as a baby. Mom? A baby? Dad? What.? How do I say this? Where did I come from? Well, you see, son, baby geese come from a little egg. Don't ask where the egg comes from. Dad, that's not what I meant. I know it's not. I think it's time I told you something I should have told you a long time ago. OK. You might have been kind of a. adopted. I knew it. You knew? Well, who told you? No one. I mean, come on, Dad. But if you knew, why didn't you ever say anything? Why didn't you say anything? How did I get here, Dad? Where did I come from? Actually. you came from this. It was just another day at the restaurant. Time to make the noodles. I went out to the back, where my vegetables had just been delivered. There were cabbages, turnips, radishes. Only there were no radishes. Just a very hungry baby panda. There was no note. Of course, you could have eaten it. I waited for someone to come looking for you, but no one did. I brought you inside. Fed you. Gave you a bath. And fed you again. And again. And tried to put some pants on you. And then I made a decision that would change my life forever. To make my soup without radishes. And to raise you as my own son. Xiao Po, my little panda. And from that moment on, both my soup and my life have been that much sweeter. And, little Po, that's the end of the story. Look at me. No, don't look at me. That's it? That can't be it. There's gotta be more, Dad! Well, there was the time you ate all my bamboo furniture. It was imported, too. One dumpling, please, Dragon Warrior size. Oh, Po, your story may not have such a happy beginning, but look how it turned out. You got me, you got kung fu, and you got noodles. I know. I just have so many questions. Like how did I ever fit in this tiny basket? Why didn't I like pants? And who am I? Good. Watch your form. Good. Better. Elbow. Straighten it out! Shen? Good afternoon, gentlemen. Now we've got the pleasantries out of the way, please leave my house. Your house? Yes. Didn't you see the peacock on the front door? There you are, Soothsayer. It seems your fortunetelling skills are not as good as you thought. We shall see, Shen. No, you shall see, old goat. Where were we? What do you want, Shen? What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City! Gongmen is under the stewardship of the Masters' Council, and we will protect it. Even from you. I'm so glad you feel that way. Otherwise, I'd have dragged that here for nothing. What's in the box, Shen? You want to see? It's a gift. It's your parting gift, in that it will part you. Part of you here, part of you there and part of you way over there, staining the wall! You insolent fool! Showoff. That is a warning. You are no match for our kung fu. I agree. But this is. Are you familiar with the master of Gongmen City? Master Thundering Rhino? Yes. Son of legendary Flying Rhino? Yes. And slayer of the Ten Thousand Serpents in the Valley of Woe? He's dead. Whoa. That's impossible. Rhino's Horn Defence is impervious to any technique. It was no technique. Lord Shen has created a weapon, one that breathes fire and spits metal. Unless he is stopped, this could be the end of kung fu. But I just got kung fu! And now you must save it. Go! Destroy this weapon and bring Lord Shen to justice! OK, here we go! Here we go! Wait a second. How can I do this? I mean, how can kung fu stop something that stops kung fu? Remember, Dragon Warrior, anything is possible when you have inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace. Peace on. Oh, Po? Peace! Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack. I packed you food for weeks. Cookies, buns, vegetables. And I even packed all your action figures. See? I don't know what those are. Never seen them before in my life. Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress. I also packed your paintings of our best time together, just in case you get lonely. That's me and you making noodles. And that's me and you eating noodles. And that's me giving you a piggyback ride. That cute? On second thought, I'll hang on to this one. Hey, they're waiting for me. Of course, of course. You have a job to do. far from home, in a strange city, filled with strange people, and strange noodles, facing horrible danger from which you might never return! Don't go, Po! I gotta go. I'm the Dragon Warrior. It's kind of my job to save kung fu. And if I don't. what am I? You're my son. Right? Po, it's time. Goodbye. Don't worry, Mr. Ping. He'll be back before you can say noodles. Noodles. Come on, guys, let's go! Yeah! Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Mama? Mom? Dad? Is that you? Mom! Dad! Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back. Honey, what are you doing here? But I thought. We replaced you, dear, with this lovely radish. Radish? It's quiet, polite, and, frankly, does better kung fu. No. No, no, no. Wait! No. Radish, radish, radish, radish. Inner pea. Pea. Inner peace. Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace.! I'm. training. The mast is not a worthy opponent. I am ready. OK. So serious. I think I prefer the mast. Apologies. I used to punch the ironwood trees by the palace to train. Now I feel nothing. That's severely cool. Again! So, this punching ironwood trees, how long did you have to do that? Twenty years. Oh, 20, 20 years. Is there any, you know, faster way? You know, until you, you know, don't feel anything? No. Besides. I don't think hard style is your thing. Po, why are you really out here? I just found out that my dad isn't really my dad. Your dad? The goose. That must have been quite a shock. Yeah. And this bothers you? Are you kidding me? We're warriors, right? Nerves of steel. Souls of platinum. Like you. So hardcore, you don't feel anything. I was. So, what are you guys talking about? Nothing. Nothing. Po's having daddy issues. I'm so lucky. I don't have any problems with my dad. Maybe it's because Mom ate his head before I was born. I don't know. Mantis, this isn't about you. Po is the one freaking out. I'm not freaking out. Po. I'm freaking in. Po! What? We're here. Gongmen City. My father's throne. He used to let me play here beside him, promising someday, this throne would be mine. A little to the left. Oh, but it's so heavy, Master! Thirty years I've waited for this moment. Everything must be exactly how I envisioned it. And I envisioned it a little to the left. Perfect! With the weapon by my si. A little bit more. With the weapon by my side, all of China will bow before me. We move out in three days, when the moon is full and the tide is high. Now, you old goat, why don't you tell me my. Fortune? Future. I was going to say future. Look into your bowl and tell me what glory awaits. If you continue on your current path. you will find yourself at the bottom of the stairs. I see. I see. I see pain. and anger. How dare you! That is the finest silk in the province! Followed by denial. This is not fortunetelling. You're just saying what's happening right. Now? The most important time is now. But if you really want to see the future. Oh, what do you see? A peacock. is defeated by a warrior of black and white. Nothing has changed. That's impossible, and you know it. It is not impossible, and he knows it. Who? Lord Shen! I saw a panda! A panda? A kung fu warrior. It fought like a demon! Big and furry. Soft and squishy. Kind of plush and cuddly. There are no more pandas. Even with his poor eyesight, he can see the truth. Why is it that you cannot? Find this panda and bring him to me! Yes, sir! One panda lives. That does not make you right. You're right. Being right makes me right. Then I will kill him and make you wrong. Will you stop that! That must be Shen's palace on the other side of the city. Great. We'll march into the tower and proclaim, We are the Dragon Warrior and the Furious Five, and we are here to bring you to justice! What are you doing? This place is crawling with wolves. Hey, isn't that the guy who hammered you in the face? I do not like that guy. We need to get to that tower without being spotted by those wolves. Got it. Stealth mode. Get out of the way! Foiled again. Now, where'd those noodles go? Hello. I couldn't help but. Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I? Where's Po? How can we lose a guy that big? OK. Guys! Guys? Hey, Po. What? Sorry. So that was stealth mode, huh? To be honest, not one of my stronger modes. gold in there, come on! This rice is raw! You stole all my metal pots for Lord Shen! Either you cook my rice, or I cook you! My apologies, but. Po, do something. How am I supposed to help her cook rice without getting caught? Wait, I have a better idea. two. one. Hey. Hey. We're here to liberate the city and bring Shen to justice. You will need help. Thank you, brave sheep, but it's too dangerous. I can't let you. Oh, no, not me. It's not safe to speak here. Right. I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc. They're in Gongmen Jail on Black Dragon Alley. What? They're still alive? They must be in that jail gathering intelligence, hatching a plot to use their awesomeness to defeat the weapon! OK, let's go! Thanks, sheep. Hey! Stop that costume! Hold it right there! Get them! Get them! Sorry! Take that! Keep going! Faster! Hey, stop! Look out! Watch it! Sorry! Surround him. Now! Gotcha! What? Where'd he go? Spread out! Search everywhere! What about over there? Is there a part of everywhere? I. I guess. Then search there! They must be close. I can feel a kung fu chill riding up my spine. Sorry, Po. It's just me. Look. Gongmen Jail. Aw, it's cute. Cute, huh? Nice work, Po. At the first sign of trouble, I'll give you a signal. You mean like Crane does? Yeah. Excuse me, when have I ever made that noise? Master Ox! Master! The ferocious Master Croc! And Master Storming Ox. I can't believe we're rescuing actual legends of kung fu. We're gonna free you from those bonds of injustice. No problem. Gotta be a key around here. No, they wouldn't leave a key around here. Oh, good! You found it. Come on, you guys! Yeah! We're coming for you, Shen! Guys, are we going or not? Do you want to meet us there later? I mean, you do want to take back your city, right? Of course we do. But if we stand up to Shen, he will turn the weapon on the city. Listen to yourself. You're protecting Gongmen City by not protecting Gongmen City? If we all fight together. Then the weapon would kill everyone. Oh, would it? Then we use. a sneak attack! We get inside and then. And then you will be stopped. by the unstoppable weapon. Nothing's unstoppable except for me when I'm stopping you from telling me something's unstoppable! Master Ox, I'm not letting you stay in this cell. I'd like to see you get me out! You guys see that? It's called being awesome. Come on! Whatever happened to being heroes? The only hero in this town is a dead one! Like I said, you are not getting me out of this cell! Yes! All right, let's go! I get the top bunk. It's time to surrender, panda. Kung fu is dead. I. You. Kung fu is dead? Fine! You stay in your prison of fear with bars made of hopelessness. And all you get are three square meals a day of shame! With despair for dessert. We'll take on Shen and prove to all those who are hungry for justice and honour that kung fu still lives! Yeah! Monkey?! You! You're mine! I'll tell you what's gonna be yours! My fist in your plush, cuddly, supersoft face! Get him! Get me out of here! Yes, sir! Stop him! Faster! Yeah! Go, go! Lose him! Yes, sir! Viper! Hang on! What? Watch out! Uncool! Very uncool! Try this! Guys, guys, guys! Maybe something smaller! No, no! Oh, no, no. Cute bunnies, off the face. Excuse me! OK, pardon me! Fire! We've lost them. Again! Again! Crane, catch! Gotcha! Guys, guys, guys, guys, give me a shove! Mantis, now! Is that all you got? It feels like I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud! Well, this cloud is about to bring the thunder! Your turn! Why. are. there. so. many. signs?! Come here! Alakasquasho! Yes! Taste the defeat! Let me tell you something. Next time you mess with a panda, you better bring a whole a. Guess nobody told you, if you mess with the wolf, you get the fangs. I've hit you twice. What are you going to do now? We surrender! You can chain my body, but you will never chain my. warrior spirit. Hey, don't forget the little guy. Did you just call.? Po, what are you doing? Trust me. I got a pl. No way. Eightpoint acupressure cuffs? Just like the ones that held Tai Lung. The more you move, the tighter they get. These are the best cuffs! Greetings, panda. At last we meet! No, no, no. We meet at last! Yes, that's it. Greetings, panda. We meet at. You are afraid for a reason. I am not afraid. He is coming to me in chains. If anyone should be afraid, it's. You. Don't even think about it. I hope this turns out better than your plan to cook rice in your stomach by eating it raw and then drinking boiling water. This plan's nothing like that plan. How? 'Cause this one's going to work. Keep moving. Ah, my old enemy. stairs. Thanks for carrying me those last few flights. OK. I threw up a little bit on the third floor. Someone might want to clean that up. Is there some sort of evil janitor or something? Greetings, panda. We meet at. Hey, how you doing? Hey. You've grown up bigger than I thought. Hey. enough with the poking around. Strong. Healthy. Look, I don't know who you are, but please stand aside, sir. That's a lady. Oh! Sorry. The beard threw me. It's kind of misleading. False advertising. Enough of this nonsense! Bring the prisoners to me. Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys. Keep your eyes peeled for the. weapon! Sparrow kick! We did it! I just kung fued it! Did you guys see that? I was all like. Do you actually believe this is the warrior destined to defeat me? I do not. I know he is. Oh, look at him. A lifetime to plot his revenge and he comes to me on his knees. What? A lifetime? I did not have a lifetime. We only heard about Master Rhino a few days ago, and we came to avenge him! You've come to avenge nothing else? Well, yeah. All the pots and pans that you stole. I'm gonna want those back. Nothing else? You probably did some other evil stuff along the way. I don't know. What else did you do? You don't know? Know what? What's so funny? The very thing that you clearly do not know! OK, enough of these riddles! Would you guys spill the beans? First, we come in and the weapon is tiny. Surprise, it's big. And then the lady over here, I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got. The only reason you are still alive is that I find your stupidity mildly amusing. Well, thank you. But I find your evilness extremely annoying. Who do you think you are, panda? Who do you think I am, peacock? Why are we laughing? Take aim. Fire. Well, light the. thing! I did! Fear the bug! Get the weapon! Tigress! You. You were there. Yes. Yes, I was. You just let Shen get away! At least we destroyed the weapon. Fire! Oh. No, he's got way more. My wing! Help, Po! Coming! Watch out! Po! Help me up! No. Get him down. Use the ropes. Run, run, little panda! Po, come on. We need you to focus! I got it, I got it! Bring it down! We're trapped! This way! Goodbye! Fire! Get back! The only way out is up. What? Follow me! Come on! Where are they going? To the top! Come on! Keep going! Here we go! You idiot! My nose! Call in the wolves! All of them! I want them ready to move! The Year of the Peacock begins now! Right now? 'Cause it's the middle of the year, so you'd only get like a half of the Year of the Peacock. And this is the Year, of course, of the Peacock. Happy New Year, sir. Get the wolves ready. We're loading the ships now. Now! Now, now, now, now, now! Move! Move, move, move, move! This way. Let's go. Oh, you! What did you do? It's chaos up there. What happened to stopping Shen? Yeah. Guys, come on. Give me a little credit. I meant for him to get away. 'Cause. it was a trick. It was a plot. I was thinking. I'll figure out his plot more. That makes no sense. What do you mean? Sure it does. Po, the truth. You had Shen. What happened? What are you talking about? I don't know what you're talking about. I. Yeah. OK, he caught me off guard. The truth. Fine. They will keep you far from danger. Real far. What? You're staying here. Wait! I have to go ba. You're staying here! I'm going. And you can't stop me. OK. I wasn't ready that time. Guys? Don't. Ready. Look! Stay down. I have to get to him. Then tell me why! He was there! OK? The peacock was there the last time I saw my parents. He knows what happened. Where I came from. Who I am. Look, I'm going. I have to know. The hard core can't understand. Tigress, no! The hard core do understand. But I can't watch my friend be killed. We're going. Maybe you can't watch me be killed? Stop being a wimp. And she's back. No. Don't worry, kid. You're better off here. You were wrong, Soothsayer. We sail to victory tonight. Your magic panda is clearly a fool. Are you certain it is the panda who is a fool? You just destroyed your ancestral home, Shen. A trivial sacrifice. when all of China is my reward. Then will you finally be satisfied? Will the subjugation of the whole world finally make you feel better? It's a start. I might also convert the basement into a dungeon. The cup you choose to fill has no bottom. It is time to stop this madness. Why on earth would I do that? So your parents can rest in peace. My parents hated me. Do you understand? They wronged me. and I will make it right. They loved you. They loved you so much that having to send you away killed them. The dead exist in the past. and I must tend to the future. Set the soothsayer free. She's no use to me. Goodbye, Shen. I wish you happiness. Happiness must be taken. And I will take mine. Hurry it up! Move it! If all of those weapons leave the building, China will fall. We bring down the building. Hey, guys. How about this? This will work! All right, let's go. I can't feel my face. Did you hear him call it Year of the Peacock? Hey. Hey. OK. So, keep it cool. Keep it cool. Keep it cool. You! Where are you going? On your feet! And wipe those stupid grins off your faces. Move, you dogs! Faster, faster! Load them all! Greetings, panda. Tell me what happened that night. What night? That night. Ah, that night. Yes! We're talking about the same night, right? Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched as your parents abandoned you. It's a terrible thing. I believe it went something like this. Here's your New Year's gift. Hope you like it, 'cause you can't return it. Po? What's he doing here? Return it! Return it! Are you willing to die to find the truth? You bet I am. Although I'd prefer not to. We got them. Go! You looking for me? I said that too soon, didn't I? Po! Po, get away from him. I'll get up. Here we go. No more running, Shen. So it seems. Now. answers. Oh, you want to know so badly. You think knowing will heal you, huh? Fill some crater in your soul? Well, here's your answer. Your parents didn't love you. But here. let me heal you! No! Yeah, like you could make me drink that. If I wanted you dead, I would have left you in that river. Well, why save me? So you can fulfil your destiny. What are you talking about? Where am I? What is this place? I'm surprised you remember so little. But you were so little when it happened. Perhaps you do remember. What? It's just a stupid nightmare. Nightmare? Or memory? This was a thriving village. Young Shen was in line to rule Gongmen City. But he wanted more. I foretold that someone would stand in his way. A panda. But I never could have foretold what came next. Get them all! Take our son and run away! Go! Stop fighting. Let it flow. Your story may not have such a happy beginning, but that doesn't make you who you are. It is the rest of your story. Who you choose to be. So, who are you, panda? I am Po. And I'm gonna need a hat. Such sad, sad faces. But now is a time only for joy. You are going to be part of something beautiful. Once we reach the harbour, in front of all the world, you and your precious kung fu will die. Then China will know to bow before me. Set sail! What is that? Honestly, guys, I never thought I'd die like this. I always thought I'd meet a nice girl and settle down and. then she'd eat my head. So sad. We cannot give up hope. Po would want us to remain strong. Hardcore. Right, Tigress? Lord Shen, what about the bridge? Nothing stands in my way. Fire! You coward! Po? Po? How many times do I have to kill the same stinking panda? Shen! A panda stands between you and your destiny. What? Prepare yourself for a hot serving of justice. Your reign of terror comes to an end. What? And now, free the Five! Disc of Destruction! OK. Take aim! Ready? You can't follow me. Just get him! Yeah. Here we go. Come on! No, no, no, don't shoot! Don't shoot! No, don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! You don't shoot! I won't shoot if you won't shoot. Yeah! Don't shoot! Cross fire! Attack! Catch of Freedom! Monkey! Impressive, Dragon Warrior. What's your plan? Step one, free the Five. What's step two? Honestly, I didn't think I'd make it this far. Po! Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour. Nice! Viper, Puppet of Death! Tigress! Master Ox! Jump! And Croc! Vengeance is served. Why did you.? Your friend there is very persuasive. Master Shifu! Quickly. Use their boats to block the way. Crane! Wings of Justice! Yeah! What? I love you guys. Why aren't we firing? They're taking out our gunners, sir. They're getting close. Fire! Fire at them! But, sir, we'll kill our own. I said fire at them! Fire! No. Po! Tigress? As you wish. Let's finish this. Fire! Inner peace. Again! Yeah! Kill him! Somebody kill him! What? No. No! Keep firing! Keep firing! Skadoosh. How did you.? How did you do it? You know, you just keep your elbows up and keep the shoulders loose. Not that. How did you find peace? I took away your parents. Everything. I scarred you for life. See, that's the thing, Shen. Scars heal. No, they don't. Wounds heal. Oh, yeah. What do scars do? They fade, I guess? I don't care what scars do. You should, Shen. You gotta let go of that stuff from the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is what you choose to be now. You're right. Then I choose. this! That was pretty hardcore. Po! You did it! Come here! Yeah! Don't ever do that again, please. It seems you have found inner peace. And at such a young age. Well, I had a pretty good teacher. What do you mean he's not here? It's my son's birthday. All he wanted was to meet the Dragon Warrior. How about some tofu birthday cake instead, huh? You know, I think we'll just try again another time. When do you think he'll be back? I don't know. OK, I don't know. Maybe never. I mean, I worry, OK? But that's my job, I'm his dad. At least, I was his dad. Why did he have to go and save China? I know why. But why? He's just one little panda. So, how did it go? Did you save China? Yep. Well, I knew you would. That's why I had new signs made. My son saved China. You, too, can save. Buy one dumpling, get one free. Hey, that's a pretty good deal. Would you like to try one? Maybe later. There's something I should tell you. While I was gone, I found the village where I was born. I found out how I ended up in that radish basket. You did? I know who I am. You do? I'm your son. I love you, Dad. I love you, too, son. Delicious, fat radishes! You're probably hungry. Let me make you something to eat. What are you talking about? I'll cook. No, no, I'll cook. Dad! Well, it's the least I can do. You saved China. No, it's the least I can do. You raised me. Po. Dad. Po! OK. Let's both cook. Together. Together. No, I'll cook. My son is alive. Ohooh! Stairs. I don't think I can. You guys, just start without me. I'll. I'll catch up! Sweet. Ah. Inner peace. Itchy nose. Ahchoo! Finally, inner peace. Now what? Kai, old friend. Master Oogway. Our battle ended 500 years ago! Well, now I'm ready for a rematch. Took you long enough! Ha ha ha ha! You've grown stronger. 500 years in the spirit realm, you pick up a thing or two. I have taken the chi of every master here. Huh! No! Yes. And soon I will have your power, too. When will you realize? The more you take, the less you have. With your chi, I will finally be able to return to the mortal world. And this time, you won't be there to stop me. It was never my destiny to stop you. I have set another on that path. Then I will find him. And take his chi, too. Ha! Justice is about to be served! KUNG FU PANDA 3 AAHHHH! Whoohoo! Yeehaw! We'll have two justice platters, please. Um. three. Three. And a few tofu buns. Oh, the spicy noodle soup for Tigress. Did you want extra sauce with that? She wants it on the side. On the side. On the side. Go, dragon warrior! You can do it! Go, dragon warrior! Defend the valley! Dragon warrior! Go, dragon warrior! Yeah! Defend the valley! Yeehaw! You guys aren't doing the dramatic pose, are you? Do we have to strike a pose every time we land? You guys, never underestimate the power of a dramatic entrance. I've heard about some masters who can win a fight just by throwing open a door. Sheeyah. Oh! Dramatic entrance? Master Shifu. The dragon warrior is correct. Really? I was just making. Uh, yeah. I mean, yeah. I am. Before the battle of the fist comes the battle of the mind. Hence, the dramatic entrance. Oh! Nice dramatic entrance. What's the occasion? Today will be my final class. Your final.? Wait. I didn't even know you were sick! Although you have been looking a little. I'm not sick. healthy. A little healthy. A lot, actually. My final class, because from now on. Your training will be in the hands of the dragon warrior. What? Me, teach? I mean, why not Tigress? She's always telling everyone what to do. Be quiet, Po. You see what I mean? Tigress is not the dragon warrior. You are. Come on, they're the five. What could I teach them? There is always something more to learn, even for a master. For instance. Let me show you another move. The dramatic exit. What's that? Wow! Are you kidding me? Where'd he go? Master. Master. He's gone, guys. It's cool. We await your instruction, master. All you have to lose is our respect. I mean, seriously, how bad can it be? Very bad! Very, very bad! Okay, okay. Let's switch it up. Monkey! Immovable mountain stance! Yes, master! I mean. Tigress, tornado back flip! Yes, master. Oh, no! Fire! Fire! Stop! Sorry! My fault. Crane, go high. I mean low! Low! Ah, my claw thingy! Uh, Viper and Tigress, do, uh, like, a totem pole poison technique! Uh, you two, do a swarming insect bite. With a yellow tail, yellow jacket, spicy tuna. I'm sorry. Good job, Po. Ah! Did you at least learn a little something? Yes. That you can't teach. And Tigress is flammable, it turns out. Yeah, that was a complete disaster. Uh, I'm glad we're not Po right now. What a loser! What was Shifu thinking? What was Oogway thinking? Ah ha ha! I think he heard us. I didn't hear anything. Uh, he said you're a loser. I'm sorry, Oogway. Uh! Hoho! Would you stop doing that? How was your first day teaching? Humiliating. I heard. Who told you? Did Tigress tell you? I heard from Monkey, and Crane, and Mantis. And your dad, and Mrs. chao from the gift shop. And those ducks you just passed. And. Tigress told me. Yeah. Did she also tell you that it'll never happen again? Because I'm done. Teaching or being humiliated? Both! I don't know why you ever thought I could teach that class. Oh, I knew you couldn't. What? You set me up to fail? Why? If you only do what you can do, you will never be more than you are now. I don't wanna be more! I like who I am. You don't even know who you are. What do you.? Of course I do. I'm the dragon warrior. And what exactly does that mean, dragon warrior? Hmm. It means, you know, just going around and punching and kicking. Defending the valley! And stuff. Punching and kicking? You think that is what the great master Oogway saw for you? A 500year prophecy fulfilled so you could spend your days kicking butt. And running through town highfiving bunnies? Yes? No! Oogway saw greatness in you, Po. Against my better judgment. More than you can see in yourself. Incredible power awaits you. Power beyond anything you can imagine. Wow! What was that? That was chi. Wow! What's chi? The energy that flows through all living things. So you're saying if I. So you're saying if I teach, I'll be able to do cool stuff like that? No. I'm saying if you teach, I'll be able to do cool stuff like that. Oh. Mastering chi requires mastery of self. Oogway sat alone in a cave for 30 years asking one question. Who am I? Who am I? I'm lucky if I get five minutes before you interrupt. So now I have to sit alone in a cave for 30 years? Eventually. After you master teaching. Teaching? There's no way I'm ever gonna be like you. I'm not trying to turn you into me. I'm trying to turn you into you. Turn me. into me? Wait a second, that makes no. Almost there, Shifu. Just a little more confusing and you'll be the next Oogway. Hmm. Oh! Uh. Sorry, no offense, master Oogway. I just. I'll let you get back to your eternal peace. What is this place? Uh. my brother's farm? Ah. If I stepped on you, would you die? Yes. The mortal realm. You hear that, Oogway? I'm back. Kai has returned! Who? Who? Kai. General Kai. Supreme warlord of all China. Huh? The Jade slayer. Master of pain. You may know me as the beast of vengeance. Uh. maker of widows? Uh. Okay, I used to work with Oogway. Oh, master Oogway! Now, he was a great warrior. We've heard of master Oogway. Okay, okay, enough. Silence! Wise and. Find Oogway's students, and bring them to me. By the time I am done with them, Oogway. There will be no one left to will even remember your name. Ha ha ha ha! Kai is coming! I am ready. To teach you a lesson. Teach me? Oh, no! It's the dragon teacher! Yeah, he's so handsome! Thank you for the compliment. No! Please don't teach me to death! Po? Oh, hey, dad. What's up? I was just, uh. Stopping by for a little soak. Okay. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing? I come home to find you taking a bath with your dolls. Action figures. and instead of adding bath salts to the water, you just added szechuan peppercorns. Szechuan what. Oh, oh, my tenders! Oh. Okay, yes, something's wrong. There, there, son. You tell your daddy all about it. Lift your arm. Shifu says I don't know what it means to be the dragon warrior. Now I have to be a teacher? I thought I finally knew who I was. If I'm not the dragon warrior, then who am I? A teacher? Teaching kung fu? Po, that's a promotion! Take the job, son! And, someday when you're in charge of the whole Jade palace. I can sell noodles in the lobby! Hoho! Why are you still here taking a bath like a baby? Get out! Get up! Go, go, go! Franchise expansion awaits us! But what about the dragon warrior lookalike contest? Oh, Mrs. chow always wins that. Skadoosh. And the dragon warrior dumplingeating contest? I have to defend my title. No one's gonna beat your dumplingeating record. Someone's about to beat your dumplingeating record! Go! Go! Go! Who's eating my dumplings? And who's paying for them? 101! 102! Yay! Yay! 103.! Yeah! Is that a new record? Who are you? I am Li Shan. What? I'm Li Shan. I'm looking for my son. Huh! Huh! Huh! You lost your son? Yes. Many years ago. I lost my father. I'm very sorry. Thank you. Well, good luck to you. You, too. I hope you find your son. And I hope you find your father. Son? Huh! Oh, my gosh, it is you! Well, don't just stand there. Give your old man a hug! I can't believe you're alive! Oh, I thought I lost you forever, little Lotus. Uh. Okay. Uh, this is very embarrassing. But I think you've got me confused with a panda named Lotus. My name is Po. Oh, right, you wouldn't know. Oh. Okay. See, little Lotus was the name you were given at birth. Really? Really! Ha! I can't believe it! After all these years, you're really here? This is amazing! Oh, Dad! Come! Say hi to, um. I don't knowI don't know what I'm supposed to call you. I'm pretty sure he said his name is Li. You. Come here. Oh. Thank you, thank you for taking such good care of my son. Your son? Now, hold on just a minute. How do we know this stranger is even related to you? Look at that. Our bellies could be brothers! That is so cool. Hey, son, let me teach you how to belly gong. All right. Belly gong. They jiggle the same! Jiggle, jiggle, jiggle. It's like looking in a fat mirror. I can't believe we're taking a picture together. Huh? But I still don't understand. I thought Po was the only panda left. No. There's a whole bunch of us. Where? Here. A secret panda village in the mountains. A secret panda. Shhh, shhhh. Whoa. But how did you know where I was? I received a message that led me here. How could you receive a message if no one could find you? Sounds suspicious to me. Hmm? No, it was a message from the universe. Whoa! Whoa. Rats! Now, what's all this about a dragon warrior? How did you know i was a dragon warrior? Did the universe tell you that, too? No, the poster did. And the gift shop. I bought a tiny cup. Oh, right, of course! You have no idea. There's so much to show you. You're gonna be so awesomely proud. Come on, come on! I'm already awesomely proud. Oh. Couple more steps. Give me a minute. Feeling the burn. Do you have panda asthma, too? Does that run in the family? Dad, you're gonna love this. It's, like, the coolest thing ever. This is the hall of heroes. Home of the most priceless kung fu artifacts in all of China! Whoa! This place is. Awesome? Were you gonna say. You were gonna say awesome, right? Because it totally is! Totally! But be super careful. Everything's very fragile here. Like the urn of whispering warriors. Someone broke that once. Who? Some idiot. Wow! This is master Flying Rhino's battle armor! I wonder if I could fit in that. Get out of my head, Dad! I've wondered the same thing! If I could fit in it? If you could? No, if I could fit. Oh. Dad, check it out! Master ram's crossbow, the infamous gate smasher. Dad, look at this! The battle helmets of master rat's army. They're so tiny! Master dolphin's waterproof armor! This is my favorite. Check it out. It's the legendary battle rickshaw of emperor hawk. Sweet ride. Ahh! Dad, what are you doing? We're not supposed to touch anything! Oh, sorry, sorry. Should I put it back? Yeah, you probably should. You look so cool, though. Hoo hoo hoo. How does it feel? Do the hinges hinge? Does it smell like rhino? Does it feel like you're impenetrable? Does it feel like you could take on like a thousand warriors. And rant. And emerge unscathed? Yeah, it's pretty cool. Ooh! I wonder what this does. I should pull it. I think I just peed a little. Anything else we should try in here, son? Hmm? Charge! Faster, faster, faster! Thumb war! Reinforcements! Ooh. Ooh. No fair. No fair. Ha ha ha! Yeah! This is so much fu. Here we go! Go, go, go! Awesome! Faster, faster, faster. There, there. I'm fine, I'm fine. There you go. Dolphinstyle attack! You got me. Dolphinstyle retreat! Go long, son! Whoa! I wasn't ready! Coming back at you. I got it. I'm going high! There you go. Come on, throw it! I'm coming for you. Bring it on, master Rhino. Here I come! Oh! I'm gonna get you. I am gonna get you! I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you! Psst. Psst. Psst. I'm gonna get you. Who's got you? Who's gonna get you? Who's gonna get you? Yeah. Who's gonna get you? Master Rhino. What? What's wrong? Hello. Guys, guys. You're never gonna guess who just showed up. Not in a million years. You just try. Your father! Your father! Whoa! How did you just guess that? Oh, wait a second. Oh, yeah, of course. We look exactly the same. Dad, say hi to my friends. Mantis, Tigress, Monkey, Crane, and Viper. Oh, Viper, was it? Monkey, sir. They're kind of my best friends. And this. This is master Shifu. Legend. Uh. it is an honor to meet you, master Panda. Perhaps your father would care to join us in the training hall. Your son will be teaching the class. Uh! Uh! Oh, ho, ho! I'm sure he's tired. I'm sure you're tired. He's tired. I'm gonna show him to the chrysanthemum suite. What, tired? No, I'm fine. I would love to watch you teach. Trust me, it'll be more fun just to watch me. Fight! WhatWhat is that? The valley's under attack. Son? Under attack? This is perfect! Now you can see what being the dragon warrior's all about! Follow me! Enemies of justice, prepare for war! Are you kidding me? Whoa! Ow! What's the deal with the green guys? Some kind of Jade zombies. Jade zombies? Jombies! Jinx! Jombies! Jinx! Ow! Lotus, be careful! It's okay, dad, I do this every day! Whoa! I recognize these guys. The master Badger twins, with their crushing doublegong technique! Ow! Yeah, that's the one! And that guy is. No! Master porcupine! I thought he died a hundred years ago. These guys are legend! Get a quick sketch of us. Did you get it? Did you get it? Oh, I blinked. Can we get another one? Ooo! I'm being choked by master porcupine. This is so cool. Oh! Oh, look. It's you! Po, focus! Message from the universe. I'll give you a message from the universe. Stay away from my son! Sorry, dad. I'll clean up later. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not my good pan! Uh, take this one. Lotus! Watch out! Whoa! Ah! Dad, check out my dumplings of doom. Gotcha. Eh ha ha ha.! I see you. Your chi will soon be mine. Is he talking to me? Which one? They're all talking. Whoa, you're right. That's so scary. We should try that, too. Maybe it'd be scary back at them. Okay, but we gotta plan what we're gonna say first. Otherwise, it won't be scary. It'll just be stupid. It's not them talking, you idiots! It's me talking through them. Kai! Who? Who? Okay, okay, okay. Enough. Did you see that? What just happened? The green smoke, just poof! And then poof! Shifu, what was that? Kai. Kai. Kai. Nope, never heard of him. Kai. Kai. Where is it? There's so much wisdom in here, I can't find anything. Yes! Behold. All the answers will be found within. What? It's blank? Are you kidding me? Not again. Wait, wait, hold on. Sorry. Oh, okay. Here we go. It is written in Oogway's hand. Long ago, I had a brother. Oogway had a brother? In arms. In arms. Sorry. He says, brotherinarms. Maybe you should just unroll it all at once? I was an ambitious young warrior leading a great army. And fighting by my side was Kai. My closest friend. One day, we were ambushed. I was badly wounded. My friend carried me for days, looking for help. Until we came to a secret village. High in the mountains. An ancient place of healing. A village of pandas. Huh! Pandas? Yes, pandas. Pandas who used the power of chi to heal me. They taught me how to give chi. Oh, but Kai wanted the power all to himself. He saw that what could be given could also be taken. I had to stop him. Our battle shook the earth. Until, finally. I banished Kai to the spirit realm. Should he ever return to the mortal realm. He can only be stopped by a true master of chi. True master of chi? Like you! Me? I can barely make a flower bloom. I need at least 30 more years, and a cave. We need a chi master. He will continue stealing the chi of masters until he has consumed it all. We have to think of a way to stop him! He'll get more and more powerful with every master he defeats. There is no choice. We fight. I can teach you, son. Huh! You can do this? Of course. I'm a panda. That must be why the universe sent you here! Okay, so what do I have to do? You have to come home with me. What? To the secret village? Yes, son. You must rediscover what it is to be a panda. You have to learn to live like a panda, sleep like a panda. Eat like a panda. Those 103 dumplings? I was just warming up. I've always felt like I wasn't eating up to my full potential. No, you can't take po away from me. No, no. I want a second opinion. Shifu, open another scroll or something. I think he should go. Fine, a third opinion. Monkey? Viper? Tigress? Dad, you heard what Shifu said, Oogway said. This guy can only be stopped by a master of chi. And I can only master chi by knowing who I really am. Well, I'm a panda. I'll pack you a lunch for the road. Do you really think Po can master chi in time? It doesn't matter what I think. It only matters what the universe thinks. So, that's a no? Master, what are we going to do? You are going to find out where Kai is. Follow the trail of those Jade creatures. But do not engage. For with every foe he faces, Kai becomes stronger. Why me? Is it because I asked? No. It is because you can fly. Go! Should have kept your beak shut. And take Mantis. What? Oh, man. Is it because I.? Yes. Oh! Lunch break. Oh. You don't need to ask me twice. Ow. Dad? Yes? Dad? Yes? What are you doing here? What am I doing? Getting a backache. Did you have to step on every rock? No, I mean, why are you here? What was I supposed to do, huh? What if the pandas don't have food you like? You're never gonna be able to save the world on an empty stomach. I consider my presence mission critical. Oh. yes, about that. We can't share the location of the village with others. So. Well, you think I can't keep a secret, huh? I raised Po for 20 years before I finally told him he was adopted. Seriously? Yeah. Okay. I guess it would be cruel to make you fly back. You can fly? I'm a bird, Po. We're here. Sure looks like a long ways up there. And my son hates stairs. So, let's go home. We're pandas. We don't do stairs. I've waited my whole life to hear those words. Rats. Whoa. huh? This is the secret panda village? No wonder you keep it a secret. If I lived here, I wouldn't tell anyone either. Now you can whoa. Whoa! Let's go! Over here! Come on! Look over there! Oh. My turn! My turn! Come on, faster, faster! Li? Everyone! Li's back! They're both back! He found his son! He made it! They're back! Li? He found his son! Everyone! Li's back! Hang on, we're coming! He made it! Whoohoo! They made it! Why are we running? Here we come! He's back! They made it! Li shan is back! Hi! Everyone! Everyone, gather around! This is my son! Hello, hi. He's here! You're here! Triplets! Hi, I'm Ku Ku! I'm Meng Meng. I'm Shuai Shuai. Your fur is soft. He smells like cookies. He's so handsome, just like his father. Thank you. Son, these are your cousins. Dim and sum. I have cousins! Welcome! Welcome! Whoa! Buns on a string. We call it a snacklace. That's right. Uh. we'll make you another one. Oh! It's you! So. That's nice. Yeah, hi! I don't know who you are. Oh, stripey baby. So beautiful. Oh! Okay, careful with that. That's my action figure. Can I keep her? Can I? No. problem. Of course. Yeah. That's why I brought her. Take good care of her. Yes! Stripey baby. You look just like me, but a baby. You're like me, but old. You're like me, but fatter! You're like me, but. woooo. with a hat. He does wear a hat! You all look like me. Let's feast in my son's honor. What the.? Pandas don't walk. We roll! Have you ever seen anyone look so ridiculous? Po, what are you doing? Po! Ohh! Ow! You're right, that is better than walking. Mmm! Yeah, that's the good stuff. Have some dumplings. What kind of panda doesn't know how to roll? Well, I'm kind of new at this whole being a panda thing. Hey, what kind of panda are you? You have a funny neck. I'm not a panda at all. What's that? What's that? My hat. My beak. What's that? My wing. What's that? My dumplings. No more questions! Go away, kid. Here, son. I packed your chopsticks. Thanks, dad. Wow. Oh, my. What? What are those for? These? These are chopsticks. They're for picking up dumplings. You mean you only eat one at a time? Yummy. Yeah, yummy. I knew I wasn't eating up to my potential! Huh? I am Mei Mei. Wow, she's amazing. She's so beautiful. That's sweet, Po. But please, try to save all other compliments until after the performance. Me? No, I didn't say. Shhh. Shhh. Shut it. After the performance. Huh! Has it started yet? Best ribbon dancer in the world! At least, that's what she said. Look away. Look away. No. You can't, can you? Dad, why does she keep staring at me like. That! Try to keep up. I don't really know how to dance! Of course you do. All pandas dance. I know what you were thinking. You do? How can one panda be so beautiful? For me? Oh! Ooh, ooh, ooh! Po. Help me, Dads. Yeah, no, you're on your own. You're doing great, son. Your turn. Oh! Huh? Yay, po! Don't worry. You'll get the hang of it. I have so much to learn. Wings of surveillance! Why do you do that? Do what? Just because you say wings of before something. It doesn't mean that you're doing a special move. It's like me saying antenna of power or thorax of making sandwiches. Wings of disagreement. Whoa! There. Master Bear, master Chicken, master Croc! What are you doing out here? Jade creatures attacked our villages. We've tracked them here. Stop! They must be in there. Master Shifu strongly advised us. Not to engage. We've gotta get in there. But master Shifu said. You're seriously afraid? Even master Chicken's going in there! And he's a chicken. That's it. I'm going in. Mantis! We have orders not to. They need our help! Come on. I'll go high, you go low. No, wait. Fear the bug! All right, you little. Uhoh! Hold on, buddy. I'm coming! Antenna of power! Ah! It didn't work! Mantis! Mantis? Mantis. Huh! Your chi is strong. Just like your friend. The bug. Huh! Mantis. Don't worry, little birdie. I'll put your chi to good use. Destroying the Jade palace and everyone in it. No! Wings of regret! Hmm. Oh, yeah. First day of panda training! All right, flower. I'm gonna make you bloom. Whoohoo! Dad. Dad. What? What? What is it? I'm ready for my first day of panda training. What? You know, learn to be a panda, master chi, save the world! Pandas sleep till past noon. So lesson number one is, go back to bed. Oh! Of course! Nobody said this was gonna be easy. Did I oversleep? You sure did. Yes! Yeah! Show him, kids! Can you do this? Can you do that? Heh! How about this? How about that? Am I doing it? Is this good? Whoa! I got it! Kablam! Whoa! Uh. Grandma panda, heads up! Hello! Ow! Oh. Uhoh. We better roll. Po, lunch time. Oh! Po? You gotta let the hill tell you where to roll. Oh! Rookie mistake. Dim, sum, let's show him how we go uphill! Whoohoo! It's beautiful. Snack time. Po! Whoohoo! You can fly? I'm coming in hot! Oh oh. Get them while they're cold. Hmm. Yeah! What are you doing there? That food is for Po! Throw it in! There, there. That's it. Feeling relaxed? Totally. Just let yourself fall into it. Got it. I'm fine. I just. There we go. Just let it all out. That's my boy. Get out of there! Oh! My noodles! Leave my noodles alone. Subtle, Po. Very subtle. Let me get some of that. Oh! Hey, leave my hat alone! We love noodles! More noodles! Oh! Just like my Po. What are you guys looking at? That's how we roll! Cannonball! Whoohoo! Yeah! Here, bring it up here. Mom, look it! Whoa! How was that? Whoa! Now, you try again. But don't try so hard. Okay. Okay. Much better. Thanks, dad. For what? You know, just for, you know, showing me what it feels like. To be a panda. So, when do you think I'll be ready? Ready? You know, to learn how to master chi. Soon. Real soon. Come on, I wanna show you something else. Come on. Sorry about the mess. I don't usually get visitors. Is this my mom? I had this done on your 100th day. Hmm. Your momma couldn't hold you still. You nearly ate the paper. It's true. What was she like? Oh! She was the total package. Smart, beautiful. Tremendous appetite. She was the love of my life. And then, just when I thought I couldn't get any luckier. Along you came. My little Lotus. I really had it all. Until that one moment. When I lost everything. Dad. You don't have to worry about losing me ever again. Okay? Let me get some of that. It's from the eastern province! Master Lizard, master Ox, master Eagle. All of them. In every village from the sea to here. Every master in China. has vanished. Maybe they are all at a party. Monkey. I didn't get invited either. Kai has taken their chi. We are all that stand between him. and the knowledge Oogway left in our care. The villagers, evacuated? Done, master. Crane, Mantis? Still nothing. Ha! Wait. It's them! No! Kai. Nice. Very tacky. How dare you set foot on these grounds! Look at you pathetic fools. Groveling at the feet of Oogway, the magnificent. You are not fit to speak his name. I am not fit, little kitten? I fought by his side. I loved him like a brother. And he betrayed me. Well. Now I will destroy everything he has created! Go! How's that for a little kitten? I will not let you destroy Oogway's memory. Why not? He destroyed mine. Mantis. It is me, your bestie! Sorry, Tigress! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Shifu. Bring them to me. Heh, ha ha ha ha! No. You must warn Po. Master, please. I will show you the true power of chi, brother. No. Oogway, forgive me. Hmm. What do you say, Oogway? Do you forgive him? You may have destroyed the Jade palace. But you will never succeed. There will always be someone to stop you. Who? The panda? His chi is strong, but. it won't be enough. He will meet the same fate as you. No. And so will every panda in that village. Yes. Huh. Po, I hope you're ready. Dance, Lotus. Dance. He's so handsome. Ooh! Hi! That's a panda hug! Hey. Woo. Eh Ha ha ha. Po. Tigress? Who's she? Who is that? Huh! Big stripey baby! Hmm. What are you doing here? Kai attacked the valley. He's taken every master in China, including Shifu and the others. It'sIt's all gone, Po. Everything. Everyone. Everyone? Everyone. How's my restaurant? We'll talk later. And now he's on his way here. He's after you, Po. He's after all pandas. How long do we have? Not long. Please, tell me you've mastered chi. Here, take the baby. Dad! Dad! Okay, who belongs to this one? You need to teach me the secret chi technique now! No, no, I'm afraid you need more time. Everyone, go get your things! Let me help you with that. I don't have more time. I need to learn it now! Sorry, you're not ready. Okay, pack everything! I am ready. Not quite. What are you talking about? I've done everything you've asked. I've mastered napping, sleeping in, hammocks, hot tubs. I am totally at one with my panda parts. Now why won't you show me? Because I don't know it! You what? I don't know it, okay? No one does. Maybe we used to. But. But not anymore. You lied? No, I. Yes. Wh. why? To save your life! I find out some bladeswinging maniac is coming for you. What am I supposed to do? Just let that happen? Yes! I'm the dragon warrior. Facing maniacs, that's my job! But because of you, I left the valley unprotected. I left my friends unprotected! And now they're all. They're all. And you would have been, too. I lost you once. I am not going to lose you again. I can't. You just did. Mom! Pick me! Oh. Oh! Po, I'm so worried for you. That I can't even enjoy being right about everything. Now run, run, run, as fast as those chubby legs can go! Run? There's nowhere to run. But what are you going to do? I'm gonna stay, and fight that monster. Po, he may be a monster, but he's still your father. Not him. Kai! HUH! No! Hungry? No, I. not really. Well, maybe just one. You know, you weren't the only one who was lying. Oh? I didn't really come along because I was worried Po would go hungry. Ha ha ha. I was worried about you. Worried that I'd go hungry? No. I was worried you'd steal Po from me. I'd what? I know. That was crazy. But I realize having you in Po's life doesn't mean less for me. It means more for Po. Oh. Well, I'm not in his life. Not anymore. Your son got mad at you. Welcome to parenthood. You don't understand. I lied to him. He'll never forgive me. I lied to him for 20 years. He still thinks he came from an egg. Sometimes, we do the wrong things for the right reasons. Look. He's hurt. He's confused. And he still has to save the world. He needs both his dads. This isn't going to work. It has to. You're not thinking straight. I am! You're not. I am! No. Yes, I am. No. I've seen Kai. I've seen what he can do. But he hasn't seen what I can do. The wuxi finger hold? It's my best move. I just have to get to Kai, grab his finger and then skadoosh! Back to the spirit realm. He has an army of Jade warriors. Oh. Everything they see, he sees. So there's no sneaking up on him. You will never get close enough. It's gonna work! He can only be stopped by a master of chi. Oh, you sound just like Shifu with the, chi, chi, chi. Chi this. Chi that. Chi, chi, chi! I'm not a master of chi, okay? I don't know if I'm the dragon warrior. I don't even know if I'm a panda! I don't know who I am! You're right. There's no way I can stop him and his army. Unless you had an army of your own. You? Not just me. Us. All of us. I finally found my son, after all these years. It's going to take a lot more than the end of the world. To keep us apart. But you don't even know kung fu. Then you will teach us. What? I can't teach you kung fu. I couldn't even teach Tigress. And she already knows kung fu! Po, I know I'm the last guy you wanna trust right now. But you gotta believe me. We can do this. We can learn kung fu. We can be just like you! What did you just say? Uh. We can do this? No! We can learn kung fu? After that! Uh. I. We can be just like you? Yes! We can? No! You can't! Ho ho ho ho ho. But you don't have to be! That's what Shifu meant. I don't have to turn you into me. I have to turn you into you! That doesn't make any sense. I know! Thanks, Dads. You're welcome? You're welcome? I'm gonna do something I never thought I'd be able to do. I'm gonna teach kung fu. You guys, your real strength comes from being the best you you can be. So who are you? What are you good at? What do you love? What makes you, you? Whoohoo! Yes, good. Good. Again. Good. Again. Good, good, good. Again. Huh? Stripey baby! Stripey baby! Faster, faster! Twirl those ribbons! Hug that log, you! Hug that log like it's the last time you're ever gonna hug it goodbye forever. Higher! And a little more to the left this time. You can do it! Whoohoo! Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don't wanna see any of these hit the ground! Wait, wait, stripey baby! Good! Try it with this. Now try it with these! Good! Now try it with these. Oh! Ow! Oh! Ow! Whoo! They are ready. Baby, hehehe. What? Okay, pay attention because I'm only gonna go over this 10 more times. The only entrance to the village is here. The dumpling squadron will take position here. While the cookie squadron will take position here. Now, on my signal, the two squadrons will. Right, okay. The noodle squadron will. Ha ha ha ha. Alright. Okay. Anyway, the important thing to remember is that this is the spot where. Okay, I saw that coming. If you only remember one thing, it's distract the jombies. Until I get close enough to put a wuxi finger hold on Kai. You got it? Yeah! Yeah! Pandas on three! One, two three, Pan.! You guys. never mind, I'll teach you that later. I wish I could have taught you this, son. It's okay, dad. I'm. Huh! Huh! He's here. Wow! That's what I call a dramatic entrance! Haha! You must be the dragon warrior. And you must be Kai! Beast of vengeance, maker of widows! Yes! Finally! Thank you! Almost makes me wanna spare your life. Oh, you wanna spare me? How about you spare me the chitchat? All right? Let's do this. I'm going to take your chi. Then the chi of every panda in the. Oh! Chitchat! In this. Chittychitty chatchat. In. Chat, chat, chat. In the. Chitchat! Oh, you pudgy little. Round them all up. Oh, no. It's true. You guys have all been turned green! Except for you, Mantis. You were already green. Now? Wait for the signal. HAAAA! Here we go! Dumpling squad! Ready? Go time! Belly! Gong! Whoo! Seriously? Yeah! Whoo! We did it! Whoohoo! Sorry, Crane. Spring roll squad! Time for some takeout! Yoohoo! Over here, Mr. jombie! I don't know who you are, either. Noodle squad! Get ready to dance. with danger! Waaahhh! Oh, sweet! Stripey baby! Huh! Oh, no. Weeee! Do it. You're mean! Fire! Fire in the hole! Oh! Yes! All right, kids! You got it, guys! Oh, no! Master Shifu! I can't hit Shifu! I can! And so can I. Doubledad defense! Doubledad defense! Left, Dad! Right, Dad! Thanks, dad! Back at you, dad. We've got this, son! Ho ho! Go, Dads! Yeah! Yeah! Ha ha! We got them now. Stop. Stop! Enough! Get out. Eeeee! Let's finish this. That's our boy! Sorry, buddy. Gotta send you back to the spirit realm. Skadoosh! Okay, that didn't work. Let me try one more time. Skadoosh! Skadoosh. Skadoosh. Skadoo. what the.? Hold on, wait! It's working. No. No! No, it's not. Did Oogway teach you that little trick? Too bad. It only works on mortals. And I am a spirit warrior. Come! Whoa! Son! Po! I was wrong. I'm sorry. Run. Run! So, Oogway. This was the one destined to stop me? I will have his chi. And then all of theirs! And you. Heh heh heh heh. You really thought you could send me back to the spirit realm? You are just a stupid mortal. It only works on mortals. You're right. I can't send you there. But I can take you there. What's that? What? Po! Son! Skadoosh. Huh! Son! Son! No! What happened? Where. Where's po? He took Kai away. He saved us. No. He saved us, but who's saving him? Whoa! The spirit realm. It worked! Awww! Get off me, you. You brought me back? Don't blame me. I tried to finish this in the regular realm. Then we'll finish it here! Whoa! Come on, son. Fight! We have to help him. We have to help him! Okay. Everyone gather around. That's it. Come in close. Come on. We can do this. Po. You taught us who we were meant to be. A father. A friend. A dumpling kicker. A lethal fighting machine. A hugger. A nunchuck chick. Stripey baby. A family. Sweet! AHH! Whoa. Who are you? I've been asking the same question. Am I the son of a panda? The son of a goose? A student? A teacher? Turns out. I'm all of them. I am the dragon warrior. Get it? See the giant dragon? Ha ha ha! Get ready to feel the thunder. This is awesome! Ho ho ho ho. Ha ha! Whoohoo! Hmm. Uhoh. Belly gong. Butt slap. Perhaps a bit of lunch. 'cause I'm starving. Mmm. Let's do this! Yaahh! Heads up! It took me 500 years to take Oogway's chi. I will have yours if it takes me 500 more. Chittychitty chatchat. Chitchat. You want my chi so bad. Then take it. Yes. The power is mine. Wait. No. It's too much. That's too much! No! No! Oh! Hoo haa. Where did he go? Oh! We're back! Bestie! I'm still green! It didn't work! Oh, wait. That's my normal green. Greeny baby! Not a baby. Not a baby! Antenna of fear! What about Po? Have you seen Po? No. He's not here? Po? Po? Why isn't he back? Dragon warrior. Oogway? Whoa! I can't believe it. Heh heh heh heh. Whoa! You are extra shiny. As are you. I know, right? It's like the best cape ever. When I run with it, then it looks really cool. It suits you. You've grown. Yep. I gotta lay off the panda buffet. Grown up. As I hoped you would when I sent the message to your father. Huh! You sent the universe mail. Whoa! Yes. Because the universe needed you. Me? You finally became the panda you were always meant to be. But, how'd you know I could? On the first day we met. I saw the future of kung fu. And the past. I saw the panda who could unite them both. That is why I chose you, Po. Both sides of a yin and Yang. And my true successor. Me? I can't take that. Just take it. I have a bigger one. I mean, you're enlightened and everything. I'm just. Oh! Really? Yes. Now what do we do? Hmm. You tell me. No. Oogway, don't go! I'm not going anywhere. I live here. Oh, right. It's you who must decide whether to stay or go. Wait. I can go back? Who knows? I've never tried. Wow! Po! Oh! You can fly! Oh! Ahhhhhh! Oh! Dad. Dad. Dads! Son! Son! Don't you go disappearing in petals ever again. We thought we lost you. No, you saved me. You all did. Now, come on over here! Hugs! Master Shifu! The student has truly become the tea. Wait. Where did you get that? Oh, this. Oogway gave it to me in the spirit realm. Oh. of course he did. I think I mastered chi. Oh. Of course you did. Can you teach me? Ready! Whoa! Ow! Ow! Monkey, help me! Greeny baby! Get her off me! Mmm! Hello. Yah! Yah! Skadoosh. Panda asthma. Ha ha.
