# termtyper

### `termtyper` is a terminal based typing practice command-line application written in Python3 using curses library. It can run on mac/linux/unix and also windows.

### Installation
> `pip install termtyper`

**Note:** 
1. Please install latest python3 from www.python.org (with pip), though python come with your system. There are some issues (like permission errors) with python that comes with system by default (as it is insatlled system level not user level). DO NOT UNININSTALL the python that came with your system by default. Just install one latest python at user level.
2. On windows termtyper works with windows-terminal but one issue is, it crashes when we resize the terminal. So try not to resize the terminal after application got started (windows-terminal can be installed from microsoft store).


### Usage of command
Just type `termtyper` on terminal to start application

usage: termtyper [-h] [--version] [--upgrade]
